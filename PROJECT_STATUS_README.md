# Property Inspection Agent - Project Status
*Last Updated: August 22, 2025*

## 🎯 Project Overview
An AI-powered property inspection system that analyzes PDF inspection reports, extracts photos and findings, generates detailed analysis using GPT-5 Vision, and creates interactive HTML galleries for clients.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **PDF Processing Pipeline** (`run_report.py`)
- Extracts photos from inspection PDFs
- Analyzes each photo with GPT-5 Vision
- Generates structured JSON with findings
- Creates HTML gallery from template
- Full caching system to avoid re-analyzing photos

### 2. **Interactive HTML Gallery** (`gallery_template.html`)
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** with localStorage persistence
- **Categorized tabs**: Exterior, Kitchen, Bathrooms, HVAC, Electrical, etc.
- **Severity classification**: Critical, Important, Good/Monitor
- **Photo viewer with zoom functionality**
- **Mobile responsive** design
- **All diagnostics fixed** - no warnings or errors

### 3. **Caching System**
- 170+ cached photo analyses in `.cache/`
- Saves ~$0.15-0.30 per photo in API costs
- Hash-based naming prevents duplicates
- Persistent across runs

## 🚧 In Progress

### `run_report_enhanced.py`
Enhanced version with:
- Better progress tracking
- Improved error handling
- More detailed console output
- Status: Partially implemented, not tested

## 📊 Recent Work Completed

1. **Fixed ALL HTML diagnostics issues**:
   - Removed viewport restrictions (maximum-scale, user-scalable)
   - Added standard CSS properties alongside vendor prefixes
   - Fixed CSS property ordering
   - Removed deprecated -webkit-overflow-scrolling
   - Moved inline styles to CSS classes

2. **Processed 904 Marshal St property**:
   - 60 photos extracted and analyzed
   - Full interactive gallery generated
   - All findings categorized and severity-rated

## 🚀 How to Use

### Process a New Inspection PDF:
```bash
python run_report.py "path/to/inspection.pdf"
```

### What Happens:
1. Script extracts all photos from PDF
2. Each photo is analyzed by GPT-5 Vision (or retrieved from cache)
3. Generates JSON data file with all findings (`{report-id}.json`)
4. Saves photos to `output/photos/{report-id}/`
5. Updates the reports index

### View the Report:
**IMPORTANT**: The script does NOT generate individual HTML files!
- Use the template: `output/gallery_template.html?id=[report-id]`
- The template reads the JSON and displays the report
- Example: `gallery_template.html?id=eab3af62-1ce6-4086-bcf3-8be09e930e61`

## 🌐 Sharing Reports with Clients

### Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to https://drop.netlify.com
2. Drag entire `output` folder
3. Get instant URL in 30 seconds
4. Text URL to client

### Option 2: GitHub Pages
1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Enable Pages in settings
3. Share the github.io URL

### Option 3: Local Server + ngrok
```bash
cd output
python -m http.server 8000
# In another terminal:
ngrok http 8000
```

## 🔑 API Keys & Dependencies

### Required:
- OpenAI API key (set in environment)
- Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pymupdf pillow openai tqdm
  ```

### Current API Usage:
- ~$0.15-0.30 per photo for GPT-5 Vision analysis
- Caching reduces costs significantly on re-runs

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Photo Naming**: Photos are saved as `photo_XXX.jpg` (001, 002, etc.)

2. **Severity Logic**:
   - **Critical**: Safety hazards, structural damage, major failures
   - **Important**: Any damage, repairs needed, deterioration
   - **Good/Monitor**: No issues, routine maintenance, normal wear

3. **Caching**: Check `.cache/` folder - contains all previous analyses

4. **Gallery URL Structure**: 
   - Template loads data from JSON using report ID
   - Example: `gallery_template.html?id=eab3af62-1ce6-4086-bcf3-8be09e930e61`

## 🎯 Next Steps When You Return

1. **Test `run_report_enhanced.py`** with a new PDF
2. **Set up permanent hosting** (GitHub Pages recommended)
3. **Add client branding** (logo, colors) to template
4. **Consider batch processing** for multiple properties
5. **Add export to PDF** functionality

## 🐛 Known Issues

- None currently - all diagnostics fixed!
- Gallery works on all modern browsers
- Mobile responsive design tested

## 💡 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Process new report
python run_report.py "inspection.pdf"

# Start local server
cd output && python -m http.server 8000

# Check cached analyses
ls -la .cache/ | wc -l  # Count cached files

# View report in browser (Windows)
start output/gallery_template.html

# View report in browser (Mac)
open output/gallery_template.html
```

## 📞 Support Notes

The system is production-ready for client use. The HTML gallery is professional, interactive, and mobile-friendly. All technical warnings have been resolved.
