Location:
- Ceiling return-air grille, hallway/entry area

Observations:
- Large metal return grille, off-white
- Heavy dust buildup on louvers
- Perimeter gap visible along top edge; grille not seated flush
- Right side lacks visible fasteners; left side has screws
- Hairline ceiling crack running past grille
- Dark staining/discoloration on adjacent ceiling/wall

Potential Issues:
- Restricted airflow and poor indoor air quality from heavy dust accumulation
- Gaps/voids around grille allow unfiltered air bypass and potential pest/dust entry
- Loose/missing fasteners on right side; grille may be insecure and rattle/fall risk
- Ceiling crack and nearby staining indicate prior movement/moisture; aesthetic defect and monitor for leaks

Recommendations:
- Remove and clean grille thoroughly; replace/clean HVAC return filter; set regular maintenance schedule
- Reseat grille; install missing screws; ensure frame is secure and flush
- Seal perimeter with foam gasket or paintable caulk to eliminate gaps
- Inspect return plenum/duct for debris; consider professional duct/HVAC service if buildup is extensive
- Evaluate staining and crack; check for moisture with meter, repair/patch and repaint once source (if any) is addressed
