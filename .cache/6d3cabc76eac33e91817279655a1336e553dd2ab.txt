Location:
- Ceiling-mounted return air grille (hall/room not specified)

Observations:
- Large metal louvered grille on textured ceiling
- Heavy dust/soil visible on louvers
- Grille frame not flush; perimeter gap visible
- Linear ceiling crack above grille
- Ceiling discoloration/streaking near right side
- One screw visible at left; others not clearly seen

Potential Issues:
- Airflow restriction from significant dust buildup
- Gaps/separation at grille-to-ceiling joint; potential unfiltered bypass and pest entry
- Possible loose/misaligned grille; potential missing fasteners
- Ceiling crack; indicates minor movement or finish failure
- Discoloration near vent; possible moisture staining or dirt deposition

Recommendations:
- Remove and thoroughly clean grille; replace/clean return filter now and on schedule
- Reseat and secure grille; add/replace screws; ensure tight, flush fit
- Seal perimeter with gasket/caulk to eliminate gaps
- Check duct/return plenum for debris; consider professional duct cleaning if heavy
- Evaluate discoloration with moisture meter; address any leak; then patch/prime/paint ceiling
- Patch and monitor ceiling crack; if it widens, have contractor assess
