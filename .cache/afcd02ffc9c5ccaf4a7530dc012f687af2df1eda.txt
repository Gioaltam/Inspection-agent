Location: Exterior window â€“ bottom sill/flashing

What I See:
- Metal sill/flashing is dented and buckled at the center.
- Open seam/gap with split or missing sealant.

Issues to Address:
- Deformed flashing with an open joint that can allow water intrusion.
- Sealant failure at the seam.

Recommended Action:
- Have a window/flashing contractor realign or replace the damaged sill piece.
- Reseal all joints with exterior-grade sealant and confirm the sill slopes away to shed water.
- Check interior below this window for any moisture staining and address if present.
