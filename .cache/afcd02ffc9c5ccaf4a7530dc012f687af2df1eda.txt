Location: Exterior window â€“ bottom sill/metal trim

What I See:
- Center of the metal sill is dented/creased.
- Small split/gap at the seam creating an opening along the sill.

Issues to Address:
- Damaged metal sill/flashing with an open seam that can allow water intrusion and has a sharp edge.

Recommended Action:
- Have a window/trim contractor repair or replace the bent metal sill/drip cap. Ensure proper slope away from the wall.
- Seal the joint with exterior-grade sealant and touch up paint after repair.
- Check beneath the sill for any signs of moisture staining or damage and address if found.
