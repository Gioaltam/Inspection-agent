Location:
- Ceiling vent/register (square, with horizontal slats) in interior ceiling.

Observations:
- White metal register, flush-mounted.
- Two screws securing frame (visible on left/right).
- Surrounding drywall shows minor edge chipping and rough finish; small gaps at the frame/ceiling interface.
- No visible water stains, mold/mildew, rust, or debris inside the vent.
- Slats appear straight and intact.

Potential Issues:
- Gaps between frame and ceiling drywall (air leakage potential).
- Cosmetic damage to drywall around opening (needs patch/finish).

Recommendations:
- Seal perimeter with paintable caulk to close gaps.
- Patch/feather repair around opening and repaint to match.
- Clean vent slats and inspect for dust buildup during routine maintenance.
