Location:
- Under-counter/cabinet mechanical area (appears to serve a condensate/lift pump and drain)

Observations:
- PVC drain/condensate piping with elbows and trap/cleanout
- Small white condensate/lift pump set on the floor
- Multiple small-gauge wires (yellow/black) loosely run; blue wirenut splice; zip-ties used
- Metal support/leg at left heavily corroded
- Tile floor and cabinet surfaces with dark rust/soil and moisture staining/debris

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust: severe on metal support/leg; potential loss of strength
- Water intrusion/leak stains around pump/piping; signs of past/ongoing leakage or overflow
- Possible mold/mildew on cabinet back/base from moisture exposure
- Improper wiring/missing protection: exposed/unboxed splice, unsecured conductors routed through wet area; shock/short hazard
- General unsanitary/dirty condition that can attract pests

Recommendations:
- Licensed plumber to locate/repair leak source; service or replace condensate pump; verify proper discharge/slope; secure piping
- Qualified electrician to place splices in a proper junction box, secure/protect wiring (conduit or listed cable), and provide GFCI-protected power
- Evaluate and repair/replace corroded metal support; treat for corrosion after drying
- Clean, dry, and sanitize area; remove any mold-affected/deteriorated materials; improve ventilation
- Seal penetrations/gaps and consider a drain pan or leak detector under the equipment
