Location:
- Under-cabinet/mechanical cavity (appears under a sink or appliance)

Observations:
- Tile floor; PVC drain/condensate piping to a small white pump
- Exposed conductors with wire-nut/crimp connections; zip ties used for support
- Rusted metal support/leg; deteriorated/soiled cabinet base
- Stains and residue on floor; debris around pump
- Unsealed penetrations at floor/wall around piping

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leak evidence: widespread rust and floor/wall staining
- Severe corrosion on metal support/leg; potential loss of strength
- Improper wiring: open splices not in a junction box; unsecured conductors near wet area; no conduit/strain relief
- Possible mold/mildew and wood rot at cabinet base/back due to chronic moisture
- Gaps/voids at pipe penetrations; potential pest entry points
- Hygiene concern: standing residue/debris may obstruct service and promote microbial growth

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed electrician place all splices in a covered junction box, secure wiring in conduit/cable clamps, and provide GFCI protection for equipment in this wet area
- Have a plumber/HVAC tech inspect condensate/drain piping and pump; repair leaks, replace failing pump/components, and ensure proper routing/slope
- Replace/repair severely corroded metal support and any rotted/damaged cabinet materials; evaluate structural integrity
- Clean and disinfect area; dry thoroughly; treat/replace materials with suspected mold/rot
- Seal/foam around floor and wall penetrations to block moisture and pests
- Consider adding a leak alarm or drain pan and monitor for recurrence
