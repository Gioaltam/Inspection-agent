Location:
- Exterior, miniâ€‘split outdoor condenser (service/lineset side)

Observations:
- R410A, 208/230V unit; label intact
- Copper refrigerant lines wrapped with white foam insulation
- Insulation shows torn/frayed areas and open seams; no rigid lineset cover
- Green mildew/algae on cabinet and insulation
- Black cable/line loosely draped across housing
- Light tarnish on copper fittings

Potential Issues:
- Insulation gaps/voids and UV deterioration; reduced efficiency and sweating/condensate drip potential
- Mold/mildew growth on insulation/cabinet
- Unsecured cable/line contacting housing; chafe/abrasion risk
- Minor oxidation on copper at connections

Recommendations:
- Rewrap/replace refrigerant-line insulation with UV-rated closed-cell foam; seal seams; consider installing a protective lineset cover
- Clean and disinfect cabinet and insulation; remove biological growth
- Secure cable/lines with proper clamps/straps; ensure no rubbing; use code-compliant outdoor wiring/conduit where required
- Have HVAC technician evaluate connections and insulation, check for leaks, and service as needed
