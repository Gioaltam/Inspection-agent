Location:
- Exterior eave/soffit area along side yard, near wooden fence; flowering shrub overhanging the roof edge.

Observations:
- Perforated vented soffit panels under roof edge.
- Fascia/trim shows light staining and small blue-green peppering spots.
- Tree branches with red flowers are in close contact with and overhang the eave.
- Wooden fence at ground level shows weathering.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in direct contact with the structure may trap moisture and provide pest ingress paths.
- Branches brushing the fascia/roof edge could cause wear or damage over time.
- Staining on fascia could indicate moisture exposure or algae/mold growth if not cleaned.
- No visible gutters in the photo; potential for debris buildup and improper drainage if gutters are present but obstructed.

Recommendations:
- Trim back branches and maintain at least 1â€“3 feet clearance from the eave/roofline.
- Inspect and clean any gutters/soffits; remove debris to prevent water pooling.
- Clean fascia and monitor for persistent staining; treat/paint as needed to prevent rot.
- Inspect fascia for signs of rot or damage during trimming; repair as necessary.
- Consider ongoing vegetation management to reduce future moisture/pest risks.
