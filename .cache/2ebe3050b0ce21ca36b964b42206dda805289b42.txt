Location:
- Exterior wood deck/porch corner at guard/rail post and stair/landing

Observations:
- Painted wood decking and wood rail/post
- Heavy weathering; peeling paint; bare wood exposed
- Board ends at corner/post broken with missing chunks
- Longitudinal cracks/splits; minor cupping/unevenness
- Open gaps/voids around post; vegetation growing through
- Exposed fastener heads in several boards
- Debris on lower landing

Potential Issues:
- Rot/decay at deck board ends; weakened surface
- Cracks/splits and cupping of boards
- Gaps/voids/separation at corner and around post
- Failed coating; substrate exposure to moisture
- Trip/snag hazard from broken edges and uneven boards
- Possible water intrusion into wood leading to further deterioration
- Vegetation growth indicates moisture and potential pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted/damaged deck boards at corner; repair/inspect substructure
- Check and secure rail/post attachment and adjacent framing
- Scrape/sand; apply exterior-grade stain/paint; seal all cut ends and joints
- Refasten with exterior-rated screws; set heads flush; replace any missing/damaged fasteners
- Remove vegetation and debris; keep area clean and dry
- Consider evaluation by a qualified deck contractor and WDO inspection if decay is widespread
