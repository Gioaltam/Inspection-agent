Location:
- Exterior wood deck/porch corner at guard/rail post

Observations:
- Painted wood deck boards; heavy weathering and peeling paint
- 4x4 post at corner with railing; several board ends meet here
- Vegetation growing up through open joint; debris below
- Surface shows splintering and end checking

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/splits and missing wood at board ends; localized rot/decay
- Gaps/voids at corner and around post; substrate/end-grain exposure
- Warping/cupping and splintered surfaces creating uneven walking area
- Failed coating; bare wood exposed to moisture
- Trip/fall hazard from broken/uneven boards and open gap
- Possible water intrusion to framing at unsealed joints indicated by decay
- Pest/vegetation entry points at gaps

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted/split decking boards and any compromised substructure; fasten securely
- Inspect rail/post attachment for stability; repair/secure as needed
- Scrape/sand and apply exterior-grade sealer/paint; seal all exposed end grain
- Remove vegetation and clean debris; maintain drainage/clear joints
- Monitor area for continued moisture damage; consider flashing/sealing at post/deck interface
