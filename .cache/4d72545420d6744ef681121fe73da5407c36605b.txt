Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet â€“ disposal, drain, and water supply area

Observations:
- InSinkErator Badger 5 disposal; hard-wired via flexible metal conduit
- PVC P-trap and trap arm to wall drain
- Rubber transition coupling between PVC trap arm and wall stub-out
- Two metal angle stop valves with copper supply tubes to faucet
- Unsealed/oversized wall penetrations around drain and supplies
- Cleaning products stored on cabinet base

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/verdigris on shutoff valves/supply tubes (signs of past moisture; leak potential)
- Likely unshielded rubber drain coupling used above grade; prone to sagging and leaks; often not code-compliant
- Water staining on cabinet back/base below valves; no active drip seen
- Electrical flex conduit appears unsecured and resting on stored items; risk of abrasion/damage
- Gaps around pipe penetrations may allow pest entry and odors

Recommendations:
- Repair/replace corroded valves as needed; monitor for leaks
- Replace rubber drain coupling with a shielded, code-approved transition coupling
- Clean/dry cabinet; monitor for recurring moisture; replace base panel if softened
- Secure electrical conduit and protect from contact with stored items; verify proper junction/strain relief
- Seal wall penetrations with escutcheons and appropriate sealant/foam
- Keep area clear enough to observe plumbing and prevent damage
