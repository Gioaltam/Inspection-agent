Location:
- Ceiling HVAC register/grille, interior room (exact room not specified)

Observations:
- Metal louvered register, surface painted
- Light to moderate dust buildup on louvers and frame
- Textured/painted ceiling around register
- Hairline linear crack in ceiling finish adjacent to register
- Slight perimeter separation visible at parts of frame-to-ceiling joint
- No visible rust, dents, or water stains on register

Potential Issues:
- Hairline crack in ceiling drywall/finish near register
- Minor gap/voids at register perimeter that can leak air and collect dust
- Dust accumulation on louvers reducing airflow/air quality

Recommendations:
- Clean register louvers and frame
- Re-secure and caulk/seal small gaps at register perimeter as needed
- Patch, sand, and paint hairline ceiling crack; monitor for movement
- Check/replace HVAC filters and verify adequate airflow from this register
