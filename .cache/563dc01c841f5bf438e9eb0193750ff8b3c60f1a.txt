Location:
- Exterior window, lower screen panel; ground-level patio/yard area

Observations:
- Aluminum-framed sliding window with insect screen
- Screen mesh heavily UV-degraded; frayed and sagging
- Large tears/holes in mesh; edges loose in frame/spline
- Glass panes appear intact; notable dirt/soiling on glass and frame
- Chair and a loose mirror stored against the window

Potential Issues:
- Torn/warped screen with multiple holes and edge gaps; screen loose/not secured
- Pest entry points due to failed screen
- Stored mirror/chair create tip/injury hazard and can obstruct window operation/egress
- Heavy dirt/debris on frame/tracks may impede window drainage/operation
- No visible cracks in glass; no obvious corrosion or water-stain evidence observed

Recommendations:
- Replace screen mesh and spline or install new screen assembly
- Clean glass, frame, and tracks; clear weep holes
- Remove/secure the leaning mirror and keep furnishings clear of the window
- After cleaning, inspect perimeter for gaps and seal/caulk as needed
