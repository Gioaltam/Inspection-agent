Location:
- Exterior ground-level window

Observations:
- Aluminum-framed sliding window with insect screen
- Screen fabric severely UV-worn with multiple large tears/holes and fraying
- Screen edges appear loose; spline may be displaced
- Glass and frame heavily soiled; dark streaking on upper pane
- Debris/dirt visible in lower track/sill area
- Chair and loose mirror stored against window

Potential Issues:
- Large gaps/voids in screen; easy pest entry
- Loose/detached screen edges; missing/loose spline likely
- Debris in track may block weep holes and impede drainage
- Stored items against window can damage screen and obstruct egress/access

Recommendations:
- Replace screen mesh and secure with new spline; replace entire screen assembly if frame is weak
- Clean window glass, frame, and tracks; clear weep holes
- Inspect perimeter caulk after cleaning; reseal any gaps as needed
- Remove/relocate items stored against the window to prevent damage and maintain access
