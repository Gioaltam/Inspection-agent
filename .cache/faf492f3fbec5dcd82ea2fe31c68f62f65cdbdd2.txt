Location:
- Under-sink cabinet, rear wall and drain assembly

Observations:
- PVC trap/elbow with slip-joint nut
- Corrugated drain hose secured with worm-drive clamp
- Rough, oversized wall penetration around pipe/hose
- Back wall shows brown drip stains; cabinet base is laminate/wood-look

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/staining on back panel (evidence of past/ongoing leak)
- Gap/void at wall penetration; no escutcheon or sealant (pest/moisture entry)
- Possible mold/mildew on wall near penetration
- Exposed wallboard/ substrate at cutout vulnerable to deterioration
- Minor corrosion/grime at hose clamp

Recommendations:
- Run fixtures and inspect all joints/trap/hoses for active leaks; tighten or replace gaskets/trap parts as needed
- Clean/disinfect stained areas; dry thoroughly; replace wall/cabinet panel if soft, swollen, or mold-affected
- Seal wall penetration with proper escutcheon and caulk/foam to close gaps
- Replace corroded clamp and any brittle/aging hose
- If hose is a dishwasher drain, confirm proper high-loop/air-gap routing to prevent backflow
