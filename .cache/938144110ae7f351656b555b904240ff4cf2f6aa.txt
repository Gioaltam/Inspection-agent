Location:
- HVAC return air/filter housing near furnace closet (filter size 18x20x1).

Observations:
- Pleated filter visibly very dusty/dirt-laden; media appears clogged.

Potential Issues:
- Clogged/dirty filter leading to restricted airflow, reduced efficiency, potential coil freezing or equipment strain.
- No visible moisture, stains, or mold in photo; no evident gaps around filter frame.

Recommendations:
- Replace filter with new 18x20x1 filter (consider higher MERV only if system allows).
- Schedule HVAC maintenance; inspect/clean blower compartment and ducts for dust buildup.
- Verify filter seats properly to avoid bypass; monitor and replace regularly (every 1â€“3 months depending on use).
