Location:
- Desktop/office surface; photo of a paper document

Observations:
- Sheet titled “Home Inspection Checklist”
- Handwritten notes: “99th,” “Unit 3,” “Michael”
- Portuguese notes include: “tudo bem certinho” (everything okay), “grama alta” (tall grass), “pro lado de dentro” (inside), “porta … vai pintar” (door will be painted)

Potential Issues:
- No visible issues; image shows only a document, not building components

Recommendations:
- Provide clear photos of actual property elements (exterior, roof, structure, electrical, plumbing, interiors) for inspection and reporting
