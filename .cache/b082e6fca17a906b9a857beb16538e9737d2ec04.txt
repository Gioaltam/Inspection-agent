Location:
- Kitchen upper cabinets/soffit and popcorn ceiling near range hood

Observations:
- Textured ceiling with dark discoloration near wall/ceiling junction
- Painted soffit/bulkhead above cabinets; visible panel seams and staining
- Upper cabinet faces/trim with chipped/peeling paint and grime
- Cabinet doors not even; hinge areas show wear
- Range hood grille/underside appears greasy/dirty
- Cobwebs/dust present on walls/soffit

Potential Issues:
- Stains/discoloration on ceiling/soffit; possible moisture or grease/smoke accumulation
- Gaps/separations at soffit panel seams and cabinet/soffit joints; failed/missing caulk
- Cabinet doors misaligned; likely loose/warped hinges affecting operation
- Peeling/chipped paint; localized substrate exposure
- Heavy grease/dust on range hood and adjacent surfaces; increased fire risk and poor air quality
- Cobwebs/debris; sanitation concern and potential pest harborage

Recommendations:
- Clean/degrease ceiling, soffit, cabinets, and range hood; replace/clean hood filter and confirm proper operation/ducting
- Reseal joints with appropriate caulk; fill gaps at soffit seams and cabinet interfaces
- Adjust/secure hinges; realign doors; sand/prime; repaint with kitchen-grade, washable paint
- Investigate source of staining; check for active leaks or condensation; repair if found; spot-prime with stain blocker and repaint
- If building age suggests, test popcorn ceiling for asbestos before disturbance
- Remove cobwebs; monitor/seal gaps to limit pest entry
