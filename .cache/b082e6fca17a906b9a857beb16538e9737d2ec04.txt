Location:
- Kitchen upper cabinets/soffit and ceiling corner

Observations:
- Textured “popcorn” ceiling; visible discoloration/soiling
- Painted soffit/bulkhead above cabinets with panel seams
- Painted wood cabinets; doors and hinges painted over; wear and grime
- Range hood front grill present; heavy grease film; cobwebs/dust on surrounding surfaces

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/separations at soffit panel joints and along trim; failed/missing caulk
- Heavy grease staining on walls/soffit and hood; fire/health concern
- Cabinet doors misaligned; likely loose/strained hinges/fasteners
- Peeling/chipped paint on cabinets/trim; substrate vulnerable to moisture/grease
- Discoloration on ceiling/soffit may indicate past moisture or smoke accumulation (source undetermined)

Recommendations:
- Thoroughly clean/degrease hood, replace/clean filters, and wipe walls/ceiling
- Reseal seams with appropriate caulk; repair/skim joints; repaint with washable kitchen-rated paint
- Adjust/secure or replace cabinet hinges/fasteners; refinish damaged paint surfaces
- Check for active moisture using a moisture meter; investigate and repair any leaks if detected
- If any ceiling texture will be disturbed, test for asbestos content first and follow abatement guidelines if present
