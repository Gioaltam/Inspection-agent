Location:
- Right side exterior yard along gable wall

Observations:
- Light-blue vinyl siding; painted wood fascia/rake at gable
- No gutter visible on this elevation; streaking on siding
- Utility trailer stored against wall; plywood deck; metal mesh sides
- Overgrown vegetation/grass around trailer and along foundation
- Large trees adjacent to structure; chain-link fence nearby
- Misc. items on trailer (cones, bags, tire)

Potential Issues:
- Fascia/rake with heavy paint failure and exposed wood substrate; discoloration/biological staining
- Vegetation and stored trailer in contact with siding/foundation; pest harborage and moisture retention; blocked maintenance access
- Trip/fall hazard: trailer tongue, loose items, and tall grass in walkway area
- Trailer defects: plywood deck warped/delaminating; mesh bent; corrosion/rust on metal components
- Drainage path along foundation obstructed by vegetation/clutter

Recommendations:
- Scrape/prime/repaint fascia/rake; replace any decayed wood; clean eaves to remove biological growth
- Wash siding; monitor for recurring staining after rain
- Move trailer and stored items away from structure; maintain clear access around wall
- Service trailer: replace damaged decking, straighten/repair mesh, remove rust and coat; store on hard surface with wheels chocked and covered
- Cut back vegetation to maintain 6â€“8 in clearance from siding; maintain grade sloping away from foundation
- Trim tree branches back from structure to reduce debris and moisture against exterior
