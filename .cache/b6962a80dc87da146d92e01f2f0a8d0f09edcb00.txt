Location:
- Exterior right side yard along garage wall/eaves

Observations:
- Blue vinyl lap siding; gable end with gutter/fascia along eave
- Surface staining/peeling finish visible on gutter/fascia
- Vegetation and tall grass tight to siding and under trailer
- Utility trailer stored against wall; smoker/grill, cones, bags on trailer
- Trailer has metal mesh sides, red steel frame, weathered plywood deck, loose tire on ground

Potential Issues:
- Gutter/fascia coating failure; oxidation/peeling; possible corrosion starting
- Downspout not visible on this run; drainage at this wall uncertain
- Vegetation in contact with siding; moisture retention/mildew and pest harborage risk
- Trailer/grill tight to wall blocks access; fire hazard if grill operated here
- Trip hazard from trailer tongue/overgrowth
- Trailer frame/mesh show corrosion/rust
- Plywood deck on trailer warped/deteriorated
- Loose tire on ground can collect water/attract pests
- No visible cracks/gaps in siding from this vantage

Recommendations:
- Clean, prep, and repaint or replace deteriorated gutter/fascia; treat any rust
- Verify presence/function of downspout; add extensions to discharge away from foundation
- Trim/clear vegetation to maintain clearance from siding; maintain positive drainage
- Relocate trailer and grill away from structure; do not use grill near siding
- Clear overgrowth and debris to improve access and reduce trip/pest risks
- Inspect siding behind trailer; clean algae/mildew if present
- Service trailer: remove standing water, repair rusted components, replace damaged deck, properly store tires
