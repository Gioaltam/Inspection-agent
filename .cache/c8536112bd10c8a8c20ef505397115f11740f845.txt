Location:
- Exterior entry door (lower panel area), interior-facing view.

Observations:
- Green mold/mildew patches on lower half of door.
- Dark brown/black staining along bottom and left side.
- Dirt/grime accumulation; surface looks damp.
- Small gap at bottom left near threshold; weatherstripping appears worn.
- Hardware (lock/knob) intact; no visible cracks in door panels.

Potential Issues:
- Mold/mildew growth indicating persistent moisture.
- Moisture intrusion/leaks at threshold area (water entry risk).
- Degraded or missing sealant/weatherstripping (increased drafts and further moisture intrusion).
- Potential wood rot or substrate deterioration behind finish if door is wood.

Recommendations:
- Clean mold thoroughly; dry door completely.
- Investigate and fix moisture source (exterior drainage, leaks, gutter splash).
- Replace or repair weatherstripping and install a door sweep; reseal with caulk around frame.
- Inspect door substrate for rot; replace door or repair as needed.
- Repaint/refinish after remediation to prevent future moisture uptake.
