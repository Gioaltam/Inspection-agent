Location:
- Ceiling/high wall HVAC register/grille

Observations:
- Metal louvered grille; rectangular flush-mount
- Heavy dust/particulate buildup on louvers and frame
- Dark streaking around perimeter, heavier at right and bottom edges
- Minor perimeter gap visible at frame in spots
- Hairline crack in adjacent textured drywall/plaster below grille
- Aged/soiled paint finish on grille

Potential Issues:
- Restricted airflow from heavy dust/soiling
- Perimeter gaps/separation may allow unfiltered air leakage and dust streaking
- Possible ineffective/missing filter or duct leakage indicated by dirt patterns (if return)
- Hairline drywall crack near vent; cosmetic but could spread

Recommendations:
- Clean grille thoroughly; vacuum/brush and wipe
- Replace/clean HVAC filter; schedule HVAC service and evaluate system for return leaks
- Seal/caulk tight to ceiling/wall around grille to limit air bypass
- Patch and paint drywall crack after addressing air leakage; monitor for movement
- Repaint or replace grille if finish does not clean up
