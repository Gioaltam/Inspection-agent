Location:
- Kitchen sink/counter and base cabinet area

Observations:
- Laminate countertop with drop‑in stainless sink; dish rack on top
- Painted wood base cabinets; two doors; aged/chipped finish
- Tile/panel backsplash; seam line visible behind counter
- Cabinet side panel near floor deteriorated with visible hole/void
- Metal door pulls; surface corrosion
- Doors appear misaligned; one is partially open

Potential Issues:
- Peeling/chipped paint with exposed substrate on doors and edges
- Large gap/void and damaged wood at lower right cabinet side; possible rot
- Door misalignment/loose hinges; poor closure
- Corrosion on hardware
- Staining/discoloration on doors and wall surfaces indicating moisture exposure
- Gaps/separation and likely failed/missing caulk at countertop–backsplash joint and around sink
- Potential pest entry point at cabinet side hole
- Rough/splintered edges and open door present minor snag/trip hazard

Recommendations:
- Repair/replace damaged cabinet panels and doors; patch or replace side panel; seal exposed wood
- Re-align/secure hinges; replace corroded pulls/fasteners
- Clean and disinfect; evaluate stains for mold/mildew and remediate if confirmed
- Re‑caulk/seal all counter–backsplash and sink perimeters; ensure watertight
- Inspect under‑sink plumbing for active leaks; dry and monitor
- Seal gaps/voids to prevent pest entry
- Consider full cabinet/counter replacement if deterioration is extensive
