Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet/countertop area

Observations:
- Painted wood base cabinets with two doors; rustic metal pulls
- Laminate countertop with white edge band
- Gooseneck faucet; window/backsplash behind; tile floor

Potential Issues:
- Heavy surface wear and staining on cabinet doors
- Warping/swell at lower door edges; bottoms irregular
- Doors misaligned with uneven gaps
- Chipped/delaminated countertop edge; substrate exposed
- Deteriorated/missing caulk at countertop-to-backsplash seam
- Corrosion/rust visible on door hardware/hinges
- Water staining/discoloration near backsplash and cabinet faces
- Possible mildew on cabinet surfaces
- Gaps at cabinet bottom/toe-kick and between doors; potential pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Inspect for active leaks at sink/faucet and drain; repair as needed
- Replace or repair swollen/warped doors; adjust hinges for alignment
- Re-edge or replace damaged laminate; seal exposed substrate
- Remove/replace failed caulk at backsplash and sink with silicone
- Clean/disinfect surfaces; treat and repaint with moisture-resistant finish
- Replace corroded hardware
- Seal gaps at toe-kick and door edges to deter pests and moisture intrusion
