Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet and countertop edge (window wall)

Observations:
- Painted wood base cabinets; two doors with metal pulls
- Laminate countertop with white edge band; no hard backsplash
- Front laminate edge chipped/delaminating near center
- Doors/finishes heavily worn/soiled; bottoms rough
- Irregular gap at toe-kick; doors not flush/uneven reveals
- Counter-to-wall caulk line discolored and spotty
- Hardware shows dark corrosion/rust

Potential Issues:
- Warping/swelling at door bottoms (moisture damage)
- Cracks/chips and delamination at countertop edge; substrate exposed
- Gaps/voids at laminate edge and toe-kick; potential pest entry
- Misalignment/possible loose hinges; doors not closing evenly
- Failed/missing sealant at backsplash; water intrusion pathway
- Water stains/discoloration on doors/wall from splashes or leaks
- Possible mildew on cabinet surfaces
- Rough, broken laminate edge poses cut/snag hazard

Recommendations:
- Repair/replace damaged laminate edge; seal exposed substrate
- Remove/replace caulk at counter-to-wall and around sink (use silicone)
- Adjust/secure hinges; replace warped doors/toe-kick as needed
- Clean/degrease; treat possible mildew; refinish with moisture-resistant paint
- Replace corroded hardware
- Inspect under-sink and faucet for leaks; repair as needed
- Seal bottom/side gaps; consider adding a durable backsplash to limit splash damage
