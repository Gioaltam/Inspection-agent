Location:
- Curbside mailbox at front yard near sidewalk

Observations:
- White metal mailbox on painted wood post/arm; red plastic flag
- Address numbers applied with stickers (“904”)
- Multiple screws along lower mounting flange
- Wood post shows weathering at cap; exposed grain
- Vegetation around base

Potential Issues:
- Dent on top of mailbox; lower side seam bent/deformed
- Small gaps/separations along mounting seam; potential water entry
- Paint wear/peeling on wood; substrate exposure; surface checking/cracks at post cap
- Minor corrosion at some fasteners
- Numbers misaligned/peeling; reduced visibility
- No visible wiring, leaks, mold, or trip hazards

Recommendations:
- Re-form or replace dented mailbox; true up/bend flange; seal seams with exterior-grade sealant
- Replace corroded screws with stainless and tighten all fasteners
- Scrape/sand, prime, and repaint wood; seal end grain/post cap; fill/seal minor splits
- Reapply/replace address numbers for clear readability
- Trim vegetation around base and monitor post base for rot over time
