Location:
- Curbside mailbox/post at front of property near sidewalk (address 904)

Observations:
- White painted wood post and cross‑arm
- White metal mailbox with red plastic flag
- Adhesive house numbers on side
- Multiple screws securing mailbox to wood bracket
- Grass/vegetation around base

Potential Issues:
- Dent on upper mailbox body
- Corrosion/rust at side/bottom fasteners
- Small gap between mailbox shell and mounting board
- Weathered/peeling paint with exposed wood (substrate exposure)
- Splits/checking at top of wood post
- Vegetation contact at base may hold moisture

Recommendations:
- Repair/replace dented mailbox; verify flag/door function
- Remove rust; replace with stainless/corrosion‑resistant fasteners; repaint metal
- Re‑secure mailbox to mount and close gaps
- Sand, prime, and repaint wood; seal end‑grain; replace any split/soft sections
- Trim vegetation and clear debris around base; monitor for rot at post base
