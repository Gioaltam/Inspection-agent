Location: Interior window sill/jamb

What I See: 
- Peeling/bubbling paint and crumbling plaster/drywall at the window corner
- Discoloration and failed caulk/sealant along the frame

Issues to Address:
- Suspected water intrusion at window corner
- Damaged drywall/plaster and failing interior sealant

Recommended Action:
- Check for active moisture with a meter and observe during rain.
- Inspect exterior around this window (caulk joints, stucco/siding cracks, flashing, sill slope, and weep holes). Reseal with exterior-grade sealant; repair flashing if needed.
- Remove all loose/damaged material; dry the area thoroughly; replace any soft/wet drywall/wood; prime with stain-blocking/mold-resistant primer and repaint.
- If moisture persists or readings remain high, have a window/exterior contractor evaluate for re-flashing or window replacement.
