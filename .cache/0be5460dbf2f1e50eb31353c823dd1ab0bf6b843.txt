Location: Interior window sill

What I See:
- Peeling/bubbling paint and crumbling plaster around the window corner
- Staining and gaps where caulk/sealant should be at the window frame

Issues to Address:
- Water-damaged sill/plaster with delamination and surface cracking
- Failed/missing sealant at window frame allowing moisture intrusion

Recommended Action:
- Check for active moisture with a meter; inspect exterior flashing, drip cap, and caulking around this window for leaks or poor slope.
- Remove all loose/damaged material; allow area to fully dry.
- Reseal window perimeter with exterior-grade sealant and repair/replace any failed flashing as needed.
- Patch damaged plaster/drywall, then prime with stain-blocking/mildew-resistant primer and repaint.
- If moisture persists after sealing, have a window contractor evaluate for replacement.
