Location:
- Side yard along wood privacy fence; neighboring structure beyond fence; overhead utility lines above

Observations:
- Wood privacy fence with vertical dogâ€‘ear pickets; natural/unstained finish
- Pickets set very close to soil; bare soil/limited grass along fence line
- Overhead utility/telecom wires span the yard
- Minor debris on ground; no standing water seen

Potential Issues:
- Warping/bowing visible in several pickets
- Cracks/splits in some boards
- Gaps/voids between pickets and at bottom; potential pest entry points
- Misalignment/uneven picket tops; slight leaning in sections
- Wood weathering at lower edges; soil contact increases rot risk
- Overhead utility lines present shock/clearance hazard for ladders/tall equipment

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged/warped or split pickets; resecure and realign loose sections
- Maintain ground clearance at bottoms; add kickboard or trim/raise; seal/stain for protection
- Address larger gaps if privacy/containment is needed
- Clean debris and keep vegetation back to reduce moisture/pests
- Verify safe clearance to overhead lines; avoid work near lines and contact utility if height appears inadequate
