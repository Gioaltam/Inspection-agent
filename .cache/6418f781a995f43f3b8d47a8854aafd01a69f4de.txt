Location:
- Interior wall with embossed patterned panels/tiles (metallic-look)

Observations:
- Embossed square panels in a grid; metallic gray finish
- Two squares show exposed substrate/adhesive residue
- Noticeable warping/buckling across lower rows
- Seams and edges slightly uneven; left edge irregular at trim
- Surface scuffs and finish wear present

Potential Issues:
- Missing/damaged tiles exposing substrate/adhesive
- Warping/buckling and misalignment of panels
- Gaps/separations at seams and edges
- Possible loose attachment of panels/fasteners
- Staining/discoloration on exposed areas (source undetermined)
- No visible corrosion, leaks, or mold

Recommendations:
- Replace missing/damaged tiles; clean and prep substrate
- Reattach or replace warped/loose panels for a flat, secure surface
- Seal seams/edges with compatible caulk; repaint/finish for protection
- Investigate cause of warping; check for hidden moisture with a meter and repair any leaks if found
- If in a wet area, consider moisture-resistant backing/materials and proper waterproofing
