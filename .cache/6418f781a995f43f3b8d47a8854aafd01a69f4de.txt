Location:
- Interior wall with embossed “tin-look” tiles/panels next to a door jamb

Observations:
- Silver embossed wall panels installed in a grid
- Multiple panels show visible dents/creases and oil-canning (wavy surface)
- Two panels with finish/face layer removed; backing/adhesive exposed
- Surface appears uneven; some panels not lying flat against substrate

Potential Issues:
- Dents/bends/warping present
- Loose/poor adhesion suggested by buckling; risk of detachment
- Substrate/adhesive exposure on two tiles
- Potential sharp edges from bent/loose metal panels
- No clear signs of water staining, mold, or corrosion observed

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged/deformed panels; re-adhere securely to a flat, sound substrate
- Replace panels with missing finish; match pattern/color
- Inspect behind panels for moisture damage; repair substrate as needed
- Seal panel seams and perimeter with appropriate caulk if in a moisture-prone area
- Clean and refinish adjacent trim as needed for uniform appearance
