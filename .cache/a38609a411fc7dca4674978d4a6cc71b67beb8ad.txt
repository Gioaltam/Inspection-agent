- Ceiling vent register (rectangular) with vertical slats; likely HVAC supply/return in interior ceiling.
- Materials: white metal/plastic grille; surrounding ceiling is textured plaster/drywall.
- Fasteners: grille appears secured (screws visible at frame corners).
- Notable condition: minor paint chipping and small perimeter irregularities around the vent; no visible moisture staining.
- Maintenance: clean the grille to improve airflow; consider sealing/patching around the frame if air leakage is a concern.
