Location:
- Bathroom tub/shower combo

Observations:
- One-piece fiberglass/acrylic surround and tub
- Single‑lever mixer valve with oversized escutcheon/backer plate
- Tub spout, overflow, and round drain
- Two adhesive anti‑slip mats on tub floor
- Shower curtain/liner installed

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/failed or missing sealant around valve escutcheon; visible voids
- Corrosion/rust at escutcheon screws
- Likely missing/failed sealant at tub spout-to-wall joint
- Small surface chip/scuff on right lower tub wall
- Stained/worn anti‑slip mats; edges may lift and create slip/trip hazard

Recommendations:
- Reseal around valve escutcheon and tub spout with silicone; replace corroded screws
- Check mixing valve and spout connections for leakage behind wall; repair if found
- Clean or replace anti‑slip mats; consider integrated non‑slip surface treatment
- Inspect and recaulk tub-to-wall seams and penetrations as needed to prevent water intrusion
