Location:
- Interior wall/ceiling area; HVAC register near ceiling line

Observations:
- Painted metal louvered register
- Two visible mounting screws
- Surrounding drywall shows patch/texture and paint touch-up

Potential Issues:
- Small gaps/voids and rough, uneven patching around register perimeter; missing/failed caulk
- Register appears slightly misaligned to wall/ceiling line
- Possible insufficient fastening; corners not uniformly tight

Recommendations:
- Reseat/level register; tighten/add fasteners as needed
- Seal perimeter with paintable caulk/joint compound; sand/texture to match and repaint
- Verify duct-to-boot connection behind grille is sealed to limit air leakage/dust buildup
