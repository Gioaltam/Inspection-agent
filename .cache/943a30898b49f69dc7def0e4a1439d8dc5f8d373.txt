Location: Interior wall near ceiling â€“ HVAC register

What I See:
- Wall-mounted metal vent/register with adjustable louvers
- Minor dust on grille and slight cosmetic gap/paint irregularity around the perimeter

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed

Recommended Action:
- Clean the grille to improve airflow and appearance
- Optional: Re-caulk/paint around the register perimeter to close the small gap and tidy the finish
