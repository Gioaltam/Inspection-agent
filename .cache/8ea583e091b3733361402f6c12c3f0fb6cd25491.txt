Location:
- Kitchen range/cooktop and adjacent wall

Observations:
- Electric glass-top range; control panel at back
- Painted plaster/drywall wall; no hard backsplash
- Wall shows heavy staining/grease splatter and rough texture
- Peeling/eroded paint/plaster along counter/backsplash line; substrate visible
- Brown streaking at corner near cabinet
- Gaps along sides/back of range to wall
- Burned-on ring/discoloration on cooktop surface
- Plastic bottle stored on range ledge

Potential Issues:
- Failed/missing paint/finish with substrate exposure at wall base
- Staining/grease accumulation; unsanitary and can attract pests
- Possible moisture intrusion indicated by corner staining (cause undetermined)
- Lack of non‑combustible, cleanable backsplash behind burners
- Combustibles/plastic stored near heat source (fire hazard)
- Gaps may collect debris and serve as pest entry points
- Cooktop surface heat damage/burned-on residue; may impair function and cleaning

Recommendations:
- Deep clean/degrease wall and cooktop; remove all items from range area
- Repair wall: scrape/patch, prime, and repaint with washable, heat/steam‑resistant coating or install tile/stainless backsplash
- Seal/finish exposed substrate and junctions; use removable gap fillers at range sides
- Verify/improve ventilation (range hood/fan); clean/replace filters if present
- Inspect cooktop for damage after cleaning; replace glass top if cracked or heat‑damaged
- Monitor corner stain; investigate for hidden moisture and repair source if found
- Maintain clearances around burners; avoid storing combustibles on or above range
