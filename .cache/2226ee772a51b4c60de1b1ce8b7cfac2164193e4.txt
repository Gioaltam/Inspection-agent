Location:
- Kitchen base cabinet and countertop edge

Observations:
- Painted wood base cabinet with two doors; heavy wear and rough finish
- Doors not closing flush; wide gap at center; out of plane
- Bottom edges of doors and toe-kick stained and abraded
- Countertop edge/trim pieced together; dirty/discolored
- Pull handles and screws with peeling paint; rust staining visible
- Tile floor meets cabinet face

Potential Issues:
- Misalignment of doors; possible loose/failed hinges/latches
- Gaps at door edges and toe-kickâ€”potential pest entry points
- Warping/swelling at lower door edges and cabinet base consistent with moisture damage
- Substrate exposure and chipped/peeling paint; unsanitary surface
- Corrosion/rust on handles and fasteners
- Staining and suspected mold/mildew on countertop trim
- Water staining at cabinet base suggesting past/active leaks
- Failed/missing sealant at counter/trim joints

Recommendations:
- Thoroughly clean and disinfect cabinet and counter surfaces
- Tighten/realign or replace hinges/latches; replace damaged/warped doors as needed
- Replace corroded pulls/fasteners; sand/prime/repaint or consider full cabinet replacement
- Seal all seams/edges and toe-kick with appropriate caulk to protect substrate and block pests
- Inspect under-sink/nearby plumbing for active leaks; repair and dry area fully
- If mold is confirmed or moisture persists, have a qualified professional evaluate and remediate
