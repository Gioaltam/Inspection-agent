Location:
- Lower kitchen base cabinet and countertop edge

Observations:
- Painted wood base cabinet with two slab doors
- Doors visibly misaligned; large gap at meeting edges
- Bottom door edges scuffed/worn; rough paint finish
- Metal pulls with peeling paint; rusted/oxidized screws
- Countertop front edge stained with dark spotting; multiple rusted fasteners
- Toe-kick/base trim absent or recessed; gap at floor junction
- Tile floor adjacent shows dark staining

Potential Issues:
- Warping/misalignment of doors; poor closure
- Cracks/chips and substrate exposure on door edges
- Gaps/voids at door meeting edge and toe-kick; potential pest entry
- Failed/missing sealant at countertop/cabinet seams
- Corrosion/rust on hardware/fasteners
- Water stains at cabinet base/floor junction; possible past/ongoing leak
- Dark spotting on counter edge consistent with mold/mildew growth
- Peeling/chipping paint (potential lead hazard if pre-1978)

Recommendations:
- Deep clean/degrease and disinfect; address suspected mold with proper PPE and methods
- Inspect under/inside cabinet for active leaks; repair plumbing if found
- Replace damaged/misaligned doors and hinges; realign for proper closure
- Replace rusted hardware/fasteners; ensure handles are secure
- Sand/prime and repaint with durable, moisture-resistant finish; test for lead and use lead-safe practices if applicable
- Seal/caulk gaps at seams and along toe-kick; add or repair toe-kick/base trim
- Replace any water-damaged wood; consider full cabinet/countertop replacement if deterioration is extensive
