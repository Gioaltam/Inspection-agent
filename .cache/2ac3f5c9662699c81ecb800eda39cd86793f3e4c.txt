Location:
- Front exterior elevation, porch entry, and front yard/landscaping

Observations:
- One-story CMU/block exterior painted light green; red wood fascia/trim and shutters
- Low-slope roof with white coating and metal drip edge; no gutters observed
- Screened front porch on concrete slab; two painted wood posts supporting porch roof
- Double-hung style windows; exterior floodlights at eaves
- Landscape bed with stacked stone edging and small solar lights; shrubs/trees close to walls and over roofline

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation and tree limbs in contact/overhanging roof and walls—pest access and abrasion/damage risk
- No gutters/downspouts—runoff likely discharges at foundation, potential splashback/erosion
- Porch wood posts appear in direct contact with slab; no visible metal bases/anchors—moisture wicking/rot and inadequate anchorage risk
- Stacked stone edging uneven/misaligned near walkway—possible trip hazard if pieces are loose
- Landscape soil/bed tight to block wall—conducive to moisture retention and pests

Recommendations:
- Trim/clear shrubs and tree limbs away from walls and roof; maintain clearance
- Install gutters/downspouts with extensions to direct water away from foundation
- Retrofit porch posts with proper metal base anchors to isolate wood from concrete; repair/replace any moisture-damaged wood and seal/paint
- Re-level and secure landscape edging; keep plantings/soil several inches off walls and maintain positive drainage slope
- Touch up exterior sealant/paint at trims and penetrations as needed during routine maintenance
