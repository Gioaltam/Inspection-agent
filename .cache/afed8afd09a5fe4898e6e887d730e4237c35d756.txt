- Location: Exterior eave/soffit area beneath roofline; adjacent to ornamental shrub with red flowers (oleander).

- Materials: Vented soffit panels (likely aluminum/vinyl); fascia board; wooden privacy fence in foreground.

- Observations: Tree branches and leaves are contacting and overhanging the roof; debris potential and possible moisture/pest ingress.

- Recommendations: Trim branches back to provide at least 2â€“3 ft clearance from roofline; periodical cleaning of soffit/gutters to prevent blockages.

- Condition: No obvious damage to soffit or fascia visible in this photo; monitor for staining or moisture where vegetation touches.
