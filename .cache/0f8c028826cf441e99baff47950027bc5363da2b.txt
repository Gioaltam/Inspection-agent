Location:
- View through interior window facing exterior foundation wall.

Observations:
- Green stucco/painted exterior wall.
- Low foundation with two rows of rectangular vent openings (concrete blocks) near ground.
- Small blue pipe/stub-out at left base.
- Grass lawn with some bare patches; shrubbery on right.
- Window frame appears black metal with white interior sill; minor paint chipping at sill.

Potential Issues:
- Foundation vents very close to grade; potential moisture/pest intrusion if blocked or soil rises.
- Vents lack visible screens (pest entry risk if unscreened).
- Small visible paint/chipping at window sill; possible moisture intrusion risk around window glaze/seal.
- Ground/grade appears level with bottom of wall; potential moisture accumulation against wall.
- No visible downspout drainage in view; check for proper drainage away from foundation.

Recommendations:
- Inspect foundation vents for clearance and install/verify screens; ensure vents are not blocked by soil, mulch, or vegetation.
- Inspect exterior stucco and window caulking for cracks or gaps; reseal/repair as needed; repaint only after repairs.
- Verify grading away from the foundation (aim for 6 inches of slope); add soil or drainage measures if necessary.
- Ensure proper drainage from roof/downspouts away from wall; install extensions if needed.
- Consider monitoring for moisture at sill and interior wall; address any signs of water intrusion promptly.
