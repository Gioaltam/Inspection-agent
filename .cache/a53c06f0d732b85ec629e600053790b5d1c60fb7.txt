Location:
- Exterior side of the house near the condenser unit; electrical disconnect mounted on the wall; line-set and cables run along the wall to the unit; gravel surface with some vegetation at the base.

Observations:
- Line-set insulation appears dirty/oxidized with sections that look worn or exposed.
- Cables/lines seem loosely routed and partially strapped with improvised materials; several bends near the ground.
- Some rust/dirt on a mounting clamp at the line entry.
- Vegetation at the base and minimal clearance around the unit/wall.
- No visible leaks or staining from this angle.

Potential Issues:
- Deteriorated line-set insulation (energy loss, condensation, potential leaks).
- Unsecured/worn wiring and refrigerant lines (risk of movement and abrasion).
- Corrosion on mounting hardware (compromised fasteners).
- Inadequate clearance for airflow and service access.
- Pest/rodent entry risk at ground level; vegetation touching the equipment.

Recommendations:
- Replace or properly re-wrap damaged line-set insulation with approved pre-insulated conduit and secure with proper clamps.
- Re-secure all lines and wires with appropriate straps; maintain clearances from wall and unit.
- Inspect for refrigerant leaks and perform a system check if any odor/oil residue is present.
- Address corrosion; replace any compromised clamps/hardware.
- Clear vegetation and debris; ensure recommended clearance (12 inches or more) around condenser for airflow and maintenance.
- Verify weatherproof integrity of the disconnect box and seals to prevent moisture ingress.
