Location:
- Mechanical room / utility space with an under-unit air handler/furnace.

Observations:
- Cardboard filter box (18x20x1) stored under the unit.
- Dusty/dirt-encrusted metal base and framing; visible rust.
- PVC condensate/drain line with elbow connected to unit.
- Exposed yellow low-voltage wiring and other cables on the floor; some loose.
- Concrete floor with stains and signs of moisture.
- Left side shows a red-handled valve knob (potential gas line component) partially visible.

Potential Issues:
- Rust/corrosion on the cabinet base and surrounding metal.
- Missing/absent proper air filter in the unit (cardboard box suggests filter not in place).
- Condensate line appears unsecured and potentially leaky (drain integrity questionable).
- Exposed/loose wiring on the floor (electrical shock/short risk; not properly protected).
- Evidence of moisture/dampness on floor; possible leak or high humidity; potential mold risk.
- Debris and dust buildup that can affect airflow and coil performance.

Recommendations:
- Remove cardboard box and install the correct size filter in the unit housing.
- Have a tech inspect for rust and repair/replace corroded panels; treat/coat as needed.
- Inspect and secure the condensate drain line; ensure proper slope and install/verify trap or condensate pan condition.
- Route and protect low-voltage wiring (use conduit or proper wire raceway; keep off the floor).
- Check for moisture source; address leaks or water intrusion; dry and evaluate for mold if needed.
- Schedule a professional HVAC inspection/maintenance to confirm coil, blower, gas connections (if gas furnace), and overall safety.
