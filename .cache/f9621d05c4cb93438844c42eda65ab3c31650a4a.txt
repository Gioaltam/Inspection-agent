Location:
- Exterior lower wall/corner by a small concrete pad, near grade

Observations:
- Painted vertical panel siding with horizontal bottom trim/skirt
- Bottom edge shows paint loss, chipping, and dark staining
- Visible gaps/separation at the base of siding/trim and at corner
- Sealant/caulk along bottom joint appears deteriorated/missing in areas
- Vegetation, moss, and soil/gravel very close to or touching siding
- Adjacent concrete pad has an exposed edge next to uneven gravel/grass

Potential Issues:
- Gaps and failed/missing sealant can allow water intrusion and pest entry
- Substrate exposure and edge damage suggest possible moisture-related decay/rot
- Dark staining consistent with mildew/algae from chronic moisture
- Low ground clearance increases wicking/decay risk
- Trip hazard at abrupt pad edge and uneven surface if used as a walkway

Recommendations:
- Trim/clear vegetation and maintain 6â€“8 in. clearance from soil to siding
- Clean and treat organic growth; keep area dry and well-drained
- Probe for soft/rotted material; repair/replace damaged siding/trim as needed
- Reseal base and corner joints with exterior-grade sealant; prep/prime/paint for protection
- Regrade or add drainage/drip line to direct water away from wall
- If absent, install proper flashing/Z-flashing at horizontal joints to shed water
