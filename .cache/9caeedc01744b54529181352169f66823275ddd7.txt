Location:
- Interior window, inside-mount vertical blinds behind drapes (right side of opening)

Observations:
- Metal curtain rod with fabric drapes above window
- Aluminum/steel vertical-blind headrail with plastic carriers
- Several PVC/vinyl vanes; one detached and hanging, others misaligned/overlapping
- One vane appears warped/bent; some hanger tabs/clips appear missing/broken

Potential Issues:
- Misalignment and separation of vanes from carriers creating gaps/light/privacy loss
- Warped/bent vane indicating heat/mechanical damage
- Loose/missing hanger clips/vanes; pieces may fall and present snag hazard
- No visible corrosion, water stains, mold, or failed caulk at window area

Recommendations:
- Reattach or replace detached/missing vanes and broken hanger tabs/clips
- Replace warped vane(s); consider full blind replacement if parts unavailable
- Clean and lubricate headrail/track; verify carriers travel and tilt properly
- Check and tighten mounting hardware; align blinds to eliminate gaps
- Ensure drapes/rod have clearance and do not interfere with blind operation
