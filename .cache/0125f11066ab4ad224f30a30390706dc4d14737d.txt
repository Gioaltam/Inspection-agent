Location:
- Electric water heater in a utility closet/area; 35-gallon capacity (label indicates electric model).

Observations:
- Yellow Energy Guide label on the tank, very weathered/dirt-covered.
- Exterior tank appears intact with no obvious active leaks.
- One top-side screw visible; slight corrosion/dirt around fastener area.
- No visible discharge piping, rust stains, or mold from this view.

Potential Issues:
- Age appears old (label references 1994 era); higher risk of tank corrosion, element failure, and reduced efficiency.
- Minor corrosion/dirt on top-right fastener; potential moisture exposure.
- Label is peeling/damaged, which may indicate humidity exposure over time.

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber inspect the unit for internal corrosion, test the T&P relief valve and discharge piping, and verify electrical connections.
- Evaluate replacement feasibility with a modern high-efficiency electric water heater due to age.
- If staying, consider flushing the tank to remove sediment, check anode rod condition, and ensure proper clearances and secure, intact labeling.
