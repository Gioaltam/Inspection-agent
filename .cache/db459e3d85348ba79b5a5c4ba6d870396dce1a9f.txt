Location:
- HVAC air handler/filter compartment on wood platform

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with return filter rack; pleated filter labeled 14x18x1
- Filter sitting diagonally; not fully seated in track
- Access opening visible; no cover/door in place
- Gaps visible around filter frame and cabinet seams; limited/aged foam tape
- Exposed low‑voltage wires draped across platform and into cabinet
- Minor surface rust at cabinet fasteners/flange
- Stains on wood platform below unit; dust/debris present

Potential Issues:
- Misaligned/undersized filter causing air bypass (gaps/voids)
- Missing/not installed filter access cover allowing unfiltered air entry
- Unsealed cabinet seams; potential air leakage and reduced efficiency
- Low‑voltage wiring loose and susceptible to mechanical damage; pass‑through appears unprotected (no bushing)
- Water staining on platform suggests prior condensate/overflow; potential for future leaks
- Minor corrosion at cabinet screws/flange
- Open gaps may allow pest/debris entry

Recommendations:
- Install correct-size filter; seat properly and replace if dirty (airflow arrow oriented correctly)
- Install/repair filter access cover; ensure proper gasket/seal
- Seal cabinet/plenum seams with mastic/foil tape to eliminate air leaks
- Secure low‑voltage wiring with staples/clips; add grommet/bushing or conduit where exposed to damage
- Inspect condensate/drain system; correct any leaks; clean and seal/paint platform
- Clean interior/return area of dust/debris
- Have licensed HVAC technician evaluate filter rack/door fitment and overall operation
