Location:
- Interior window at exterior wall (room not specified)

Observations:
- Textured drywall around window
- White-framed window with exterior insect screen
- Horizontal mini-blinds; several slats bent/creased; cords tangled; blinds uneven
- Window track/sill shows dirt/debris; light discoloration
- Interior caulk at frame-to-wall/sill joints appears thin/cracked in spots
- Small nail holes/pinholes in wall finish

Potential Issues:
- Blinds: bent/warped slats; misalignment; possible damaged lift cords (loose/missing parts)
- Failed/missing sealant at interior window perimeter (gaps/voids) â€“ potential air/water/pest infiltration
- Debris/discoloration in window track may indicate moisture accumulation; possible mildew starting
- Minor wall surface holes; cosmetic only

Recommendations:
- Replace or repair blinds; consider cordless or add cord cleat/tensioner for safety
- Clean window track/sill; disinfect; monitor for recurring moisture
- Re-caulk/seal interior frame-to-wall/sill joints with paintable sealant; check exterior caulking/weatherstripping and reseal as needed
- Patch nail/pin holes and touch-up paint
