Location:
- Interior window, right jamb/sill area with horizontal mini-blinds

Observations:
- Textured painted drywall around window
- Aluminum/vinyl single-hung style window with insect screen
- Horizontal mini-blinds; several slats bent/creased and misaligned
- Light debris/dust visible in bottom window track/sill
- Small pinholes/blemishes in wall finish

Potential Issues:
- Blinds: multiple slats bent/warped and misaligned; one slat displaced
- Debris buildup in window track may impede drainage
- Minor wall surface damage (small holes/blemishes)

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace damaged/misaligned blind slats or replace blind assembly
- Vacuum/clean window track and sill; clear weep holes
- Patch/spot-repair wall holes; touch-up paint
- Inspect perimeter caulk at frame-to-wall; reseal any gaps if found
