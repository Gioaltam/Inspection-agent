Location:
- Exterior entry door, hinge-side jamb and threshold at concrete stoop

Observations:
- Painted wood jamb/trim with aluminum/metal liner and threshold
- Rubber weatherstrip present; sections torn/missing
- Extensive paint failure; peeling/flaking
- Large wood loss/voids; splintered/soft areas, especially near base
- Metal liner wavy/bent with exposed screws
- Caulk absent/deteriorated at joints; bare wood and insulation visible
- Concrete stoop abuts threshold

Potential Issues:
- Severe wood rot/decay with substrate exposure
- Cracks/splits and large gaps/voids along jamb and at base
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk; damaged/missing weatherstripping
- Deformed metal liner; possible loose fasteners; frame strength/security compromised
- High risk of water intrusion at jamb/threshold-to-concrete interface; possible hidden framing damage
- Pest entry points through open gaps; possible wood-destroying organism activity
- Possible mold/mildew within decayed wood (not fully visible)

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/trim; consider full pre-hung door unit replacement with rot-resistant materials
- Install proper flashing/sill pan; seal joints with backer rod and quality exterior sealant; ensure drainage away from door
- Replace weatherstripping/sweep; verify alignment and secure fasteners
- Prep/prime/paint all new/exposed wood; maintain caulked joints
- Inspect adjacent framing/threshold for concealed moisture damage and repair as needed
- Evaluate moisture sources and inspect/treat for termites/ants; seal all gaps to prevent pests and air leakage
