Location:
- Exterior entry door frame/threshold at sidewalk/patio

Observations:
- Painted wood jamb and brickmould; metal threshold/sill
- Extensive paint failure; bare, splintered wood exposed
- Large voids and missing sections at lower jamb
- Weatherstripping torn/missing; caulk/sealant deteriorated
- Fasteners visible; some surface rust
- Sealant remnants along metal jamb/threshold

Potential Issues:
- Severe wood rot/decay at lower door jamb and casing
- Gaps/voids/separations allow water and air intrusion
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk; substrate exposure
- Potential leak path at threshold-to-jamb joint
- Loose/damaged trim; possible compromised door anchoring
- Pest entry points through open cavities
- Corrosion on screws/fasteners

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/brickmould and damaged weatherstripping
- Evaluate entire door assembly; replace door unit if framing decay extends
- Reseat/replace threshold; properly flash and seal all interfaces
- Apply exterior-grade backer rod/caulk; repaint with quality exterior paint
- Inspect adjacent framing for moisture damage; treat/repair as needed
- Consider pest/termite inspection due to conducive conditions
- Monitor interior side for moisture staining after repairs
