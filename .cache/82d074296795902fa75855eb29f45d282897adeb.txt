Location:
- Interior living area, TV/media wall setup.

Observations:
- Vertical metal mounting column attached to wall with a horizontal TV mounting arm.
- Glass/wood console table beneath; curved edge, two open shelves.
- Standard 120V duplex outlet on left wall; a loose cord runs along the baseboard.
- Minor cosmetic scuffs on the mounting post; no visible water damage or mold.

Potential Issues:
- Unverified wall anchorage: mounting column may not be secured to wall studs or appropriate anchors.
- Cable management: loose cords along baseboard pose trip and pull hazards.
- No visible anti-tip strap or wall restraint for the tall mount.
- Weight/compatibility unknown: ensure TV mounting plate and hardware match TV size/weight and VESA pattern.

Recommendations:
- Verify mounting hardware is anchored into wall studs or use approved anchors; tighten all fasteners.
- Install an anti-tip strap or secure mounting to wall to prevent tipping.
- Organize/secure cables with clips or a cover; route cords to outlets to reduce pull risk.
- Confirm TV weight rating and VESA compatibility; ensure the mount is level and stable.
