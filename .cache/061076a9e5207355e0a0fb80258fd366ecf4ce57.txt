Location:
- Exterior first‑floor window on a blue siding wall (aluminum frame with two sashes; interior blinds).

Observations:
- Double‑hung style window with blinds on both sashes; pull cord visible.
- Perimeter trim/sill shows paint wear and minor aging.
- Bottom sash area and frame appear somewhat misaligned with a visible seam between sashes.
- Bottom track/disc area shows a dark discoloration; possible corrosion or dirt.
- Vegetation plantings located close to the base right of the window.

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids around window perimeter (potential air/water leakage).
- Misalignment between upper and lower sash (may affect sealing/operation).
- Corrosion/dirt on bottom sash track or frame.
- Deteriorated or missing exterior sealant/caulk around the frame.
- Plant/vegetation in contact with siding near the window (moisture/pest entry risk).

Recommendations:
- Inspect sash operation; reseal/realign as needed; replace worn weatherstripping.
- Recaulk around the exterior perimeter; ensure proper flashing to shed water.
- Clean/repair bottom track; address corrosion or replace hardware as needed.
- Trim back vegetation and maintain clearance from the siding/window.
- If interior signs of moisture or staining appear, evaluate for past leaks and consider window replacement if energy efficiency is poor.
