Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit (Ameristar) on a metal stand, adjacent to stucco wall, under overhead vegetation.

Observations:
- Debris/leaves on top of unit; palm fronds above and around unit.
- Unit has limited side/top clearance against wall and framework.
- Frame shows some surface rust/dirt buildup.
- Electrical disconnect box mounted on wall nearby; conduit/wiring not clearly visible.
- No obvious visible dents/cracks in the cabinet; overall light cosmetic wear.

Potential Issues:
- Debris and vegetation can restrict airflow and promote corrosion.
- Inadequate clearance around the condenser (airflow and service access) may reduce efficiency and shorten life.
- Rust on framing members could worsen and compromise support if unsurfaced.
- Proximity to vegetation/pests; potential for ingress and moisture issues.
- Need to confirm electrical disconnect is weatherproof and properly wired.

Recommendations:
- Remove debris and trim vegetation to maintain at least 3 ft clearance around the unit and 1 ft above the top.
- Inspect and treat/repair frame rust; repaint or replace as needed.
- Have HVAC tech clean coils and verify refrigerant pressures; check condensate drain if applicable.
- Verify electrical disconnect condition, enclosure rating, and wiring; ensure proper conduit routing and grounding.
