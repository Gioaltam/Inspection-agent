Location:
- Front yards of two adjacent single-family homes (white house left, red house right) on a residential street.

Observations:
- Cracked and uneven concrete sidewalk/curb area near the street.
- Grass/weeds growing in joints and encroaching onto the path to the red house.
- Blue utility marker flag visible in the lawn.
- White house has a wheelchair-access ramp with railing; red house has a small set of steps to the entry.
- Exterior siding appears fair (white vinyl on one, painted wood on the other).

Potential Issues:
- Trip hazards from cracked/uneven sidewalk and curb.
- Vegetation in joints may retain moisture and contribute to deterioration or pest entry.
- Possible drainage issues not evident but worth checking (water flow away from foundations).

Recommendations:
- Repair/replace cracked sidewalk sections and relevel as needed; ensure smooth, safe entry paths.
- Remove weeds, reseal joints or install edging to prevent recurrence; maintain at least 6 inches of clearance from foundation.
- Inspect ramp/handrails for compliance and safety; address any loose or unsafe components.
- Verify proper drainage away from foundations during site grading improvements.
