Location:
- Exterior wall near electric meter panel, yard side/back of house

Observations:
- Horizontal vinyl siding; large aluminum-framed window (no exterior screen visible)
- Mini-blinds inside window bent/damaged
- Electric meter and weatherproof metal enclosure mounted on siding
- Heavy vegetation/weeds against wall and around utilities
- Area cluttered with hand trucks/dollies, sawhorses, trash can and misc. items leaning on wall/window

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation and debris in contact with siding/window; pest harborage and moisture retention risk
- Clutter and overgrowth obstruct window and electrical equipment; trip hazards and inadequate working clearance for electrical service
- Corrosion/peeling paint on exterior electrical enclosure; potential deterioration/compromised weather protection
- Unsecured leaning equipment (dollies/sawhorses) could fall and cause injury or damage
- Missing window screen may allow pests in when window is opened

Recommendations:
- Clear and relocate stored items; maintain safe egress at window and required electrical clearances (approx. 36 in. depth, 30 in. width)
- Trim/remove vegetation; keep 12â€“18 in. clearance from siding and utilities; maintain ground drainage away from wall
- Have a licensed electrician evaluate corroded exterior enclosure; clean/treat rust and repaint or replace; verify weather sealing
- Secure or properly store equipment; remove trash/debris to eliminate trip hazards
- Install/repair window screen; clean window and siding
- Seal any visible gaps around electrical penetrations with exterior-rated sealant after clearing obstructions
