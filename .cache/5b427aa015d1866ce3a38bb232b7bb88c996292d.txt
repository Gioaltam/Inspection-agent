Location:
- Exterior wall at window near electric meter/service, side/rear yard

Observations:
- Vinyl lap siding; aluminum/vinyl framed window; blinds damaged/misaligned
- No window insect screen visible
- Metal electric meter/service enclosure with peeling paint
- Dense weeds/vines against wall and window
- Area cluttered with hand trucks, sawhorses, trash bin

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with siding/window; potential moisture retention and pest harborage
- Stored items and vegetation obstruct window and electrical equipment clearance (blocked/unsafe condition)
- Trip/fall hazard from tools/debris and tall grass
- Meter/service enclosure shows peeling paint and visible surface corrosion/rust

Recommendations:
- Cut back and remove vegetation; keep 6â€“12 in. clearance from siding and around window
- Remove/relocate stored items; maintain ~3 ft clear working space around electrical equipment and keep window accessible
- Clean and organize area to eliminate trip hazards
- Prep, treat rust, and repaint metal enclosure; have electrician evaluate if corrosion affects enclosure integrity/weatherproofing
- After clearing, inspect siding/window perimeter for gaps or damage and seal/caulk as needed
- Replace/repair window screen and blinds if desired
