Potential Issues:
- Regional compliance: Nameplate prohibits installation in Southwest region; if property is in that region this unit may be non-compliant with regional efficiency rules
- Debris/vegetation visible at base/coil area that can restrict airflow

Recommendations:
- If located in the Southwest region, have a licensed HVAC contractor evaluate for compliance and advise on replacement/permit implications
- Clear debris/vegetation around condenser; maintain adequate airflow clearance and keep coil clean
- Verify branch-circuit breaker/fuse size and conductor gauge match nameplate (MCA 16.8A; max 25A); correct if mismatched
