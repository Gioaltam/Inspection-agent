Location:
- Kitchen galley with rear utility/storage area behind doorway.

Observations:
- Left: refrigerator; right: electric range with smooth top; right-side double sink with faucet; white cabinets above/below; white tile flooring.
- Back area contains electrical panel and service disconnect mounted on wall; some conduit/feeds visible.
- A loose panel/board is leaning against the back wall in the utility space.
- Door trim around the doorway appears aged/discolored; walls painted light gray.

Potential Issues:
- Electrical panel in a small, has-access utility space; uncertain clearance in front of panel (verify meets code minimum). 
- Loose panel/board stored in the utility area could obstruct access or fall.
- Back wall shows minor staining/dirt near floor; potential past moisture issue (investigate for leaks).
- No visible backsplash or caulk detail around sink/counter seams (water intrusion risk if not sealed).

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed electrician confirm proper working clearances and panel accessibility; ensure panel is properly covered/labelled.
- Remove and secure the loose panel/board in the utility area; tidy storage to maintain access.
- Inspect back wall for moisture/leaks; repair any staining and seal/openings.
- Seal seams around sink and countertops with appropriate caulk; install backsplash if desired for moisture protection.
- General cleaning and touch-up paint as needed for frame and trim.
