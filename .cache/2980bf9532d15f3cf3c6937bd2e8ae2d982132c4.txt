- Outdoor condenser unit (split-system) with steel cabinet and aluminum fins; located on a concrete pad.
- Coil fins dirty with grime; minor bending observed (lower-left quadrant) may reduce airflow.
- Vegetation contacting unit; weeds and stems growing around the base and sides.
- Clearance appears limited; recommend at least 12 in side clearance and 60 in above for proper airflow.
- No visible refrigerant line or wiring damage from this view; suggest cleaning and trim vegetation or service as needed.
