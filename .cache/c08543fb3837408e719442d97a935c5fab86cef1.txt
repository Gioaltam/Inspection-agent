Location:
- Utility/mechanical area – electric water heater (EnergyGuide label side)

Observations:
- Electric water heater; EnergyGuide shows 35-gallon first-hour rating
- Listed energy use: ~4,828 kWh/yr; estimated yearly cost $406 (1994 basis)
- Model on label: 81SV30D (D13880)
- Label is aged/worn; tank exterior white with gray top band
- Light rust/discoloration visible along top seam and near side access panel
- No visible dents, warping, cracks, or missing screws on visible areas

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust staining at top seam and around element/access panel – indicates past or ongoing moisture
- Apparent advanced age (1990s-era unit) – elevated risk of tank/component failure and leaks
- No visible gaps, loose/missing fasteners, substrate exposure, wiring issues, or obvious leaks on the shown side

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber evaluate corrosion and check for active leaks at top connections and element gasket
- Plan for replacement due to age/efficiency and increased failure risk
- Clean and monitor for new rust or moisture; install drip pan and drain to an approved location if not present
- Verify TPR valve and discharge piping, electrical connection, bonding/grounding, and seismic strapping (if required) during full system inspection
