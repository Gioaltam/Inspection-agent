Location:
- Exterior window sill area on brick veneer wall; white painted masonry sill with black window frame.

Observations:
- White sill shows chipping/rough edges and some surface wear.
- Adjacent white trim has cracking and paint peeling.
- Debris on sill; blinds/slider in place; no obvious interior leaks visible from this view.

Potential Issues:
- Paint/finish failure on sill and trim â€“ potential moisture exposure.
- Exposed substrate at sill edge (chips) that could allow water intrusion.
- Possible deterioration behind paint if moisture has been penetrating (not visible, but risk).

Recommendations:
- Repaint and reseal sill and trim; fill cracks and smooth edges.
- Inspect for wood rot behind peeling areas; replace damaged trim if needed.
- Re-caulk gaps around window to ensure proper weather seal and flashing.
- Clean area and monitor for any interior signs of water intrusion or staining.
