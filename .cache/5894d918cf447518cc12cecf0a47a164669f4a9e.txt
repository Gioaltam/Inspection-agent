Location:
- Kitchen (galley layout), view toward laundry/utility room

Observations:
- Textured “popcorn” ceiling with surface-mounted bare-bulb light
- Tile floor; painted wood/laminate cabinets; laminate counters; double-basin sink
- Window over sink; refrigerator, microwave, electric range; ceiling supply register

Potential Issues:
- Ceiling: large areas of peeling/blistered texture/paint and delamination suggesting moisture damage/water intrusion
- Exposed bulb fixture with missing/damaged globe/diffuser; long pull cord
- Base cabinets and doors: heavy wear with swelling/warping, delamination, peeling paint; substrate exposure along toe-kicks
- Cabinet doors/drawers misaligned; hardware appears loose/damaged in places
- Possible failed/missing sealant at sink/counter and wall transitions (gaps visible)
- No GFCI receptacles visible at countertop near sink (shock hazard)
- Gaps/voids at lower cabinet bases/toe-kicks that can serve as pest entry points
- Trip hazard: mop/bucket and clutter in primary walkway

Recommendations:
- Determine and repair source of ceiling moisture (roof/plumbing/HVAC); replace damaged drywall/texture and repaint after drying; check attic above
- Replace or rebuild deteriorated base cabinetry; correct misalignment; replace damaged hardware
- Clean and reseal sink rim and counter-to-wall joints with kitchen-grade silicone; add backsplash protection as needed
- Replace exposed-bulb fixture with a covered, code-compliant light; secure pull chain or replace with wall switch
- Install GFCI (and AFCI where required) protection for all kitchen countertop circuits; verify proper grounding
- Seal gaps at cabinet bases and other penetrations to reduce pest entry; inspect for activity
- Remove clutter from floor to maintain a clear, safe path
- If ceiling texture is from an older renovation, test for asbestos before disturbance and use licensed abatement if positive
