Location:
- Exterior wall siding at the bottom edge near the foundation/grade line.

Observations:
- Horizontal siding with peeling, cracking paint along the bottom edge.
- Multiple cracks and chips in the paint; some areas show exposed substrate.
- Gap/seam visible between siding and the lower trim; yellowish caulk at the base.
- No visible mold or staining in this small view.

Potential Issues:
- Moisture intrusion risk from peeling paint and cracks.
- Possible wood/fiber-cement rot behind compromised areas.
- Gaps and deteriorated caulk near grade may allow water and pest entry.
- Possible misalignment or loose fasteners at the bottom edge.

Recommendations:
- Scrape/pressure wash and re-seal/paint affected areas after substrate prep.
- Inspect underlying boards for rot; replace any softened/rotted sections.
- Re-caulk joints and gaps with exterior-grade sealant; ensure proper flashing at the base.
- Check grading and drainage to direct water away from the siding; correct if needed.
