Location:
- Front curb/sidewalk area, street mailbox

Observations:
- Metal mailbox with red flag mounted on painted wood post and horizontal arm
- House numbers applied; door hardware/screws present
- Post lacks cap; end-grain exposed; weathered/peeling paint
- Small dent visible on mailbox top/front
- Rock placed against base; vegetation around base; pavement/curb cracking nearby

Potential Issues:
- Dents on mailbox body (top/front)
- Cracked/peeling paint with exposed wood/substrate on post/arm; end-grain exposed
- Wood splitting at top of post; potential water entry
- Possible loose/unstable post (rock at base suggests bracing)
- Wood post in direct soil contact—elevated risk of rot/decay
- Trip hazard from loose rock at base near sidewalk/curb
- Cracked pavement/curb edge adjacent—trip/ankle hazard

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace dented mailbox if operation is affected
- Sand/prime/seal and repaint wood; add a post cap or seal end-grain
- Inspect post for looseness/decay; reset in proper footing or replace; verify USPS height/setback
- Remove rock and regrade/compact soil; keep base clear and trimmed
- Report curb/pavement hazards to local authority if not on private property
