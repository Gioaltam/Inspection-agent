Location:
- Curbside/front yard at street, beside sidewalk

Observations:
- White metal mailbox on painted wood post with horizontal support arm
- Red flag present; address numbers applied
- Vegetation and soil around post base; loose rock bracing at base
- Curb/edge of pavement visibly cracked nearby

Potential Issues:
- Dent on mailbox body/top; slight misalignment at door seam
- Peeling paint and exposed wood at post top; surface checking/splits
- Possible looseness of post (stone used as brace suggests instability)
- Wood in direct soil contact; moisture/rot risk
- Minor warping/sag of support arm; potential fastener loosening
- Trip/fall hazard: loose rock at base and cracked curb edge
- Vegetation encroachment can hold moisture and attract pests

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace dented mailbox; verify door closes/seals and flag operates
- Scrape/sand, prime, and repaint post; seal cut ends; replace any decayed sections
- Remove rock; re-set and secure post plumb in concrete as needed; verify USPS height/setback
- Tighten/replace fasteners on support arm
- Trim/clear vegetation; keep soil/wood separation or add gravel barrier
- Address cracked curb/edge and remove trip hazards (coordinate with municipality if in right-of-way)
