Location:
- HVAC return air filter compartment (likely furnace/air handler area).

Observations:
- 14x18x1 pleated filter installed; visibly dusty/loaded with dust on pleats.
- Dirt/debris present on bottom surface of the return plenum.
- Filter frame and surrounding metal appear intact; no obvious rust or moisture stains.
- No visible mold, water intrusion, or wiring/conduit issues in the image.

Potential Issues:
- Heavily loaded filter reducing airflow and system efficiency.
- Dust accumulation in plenum could impact air quality and distribution.
- No clear evidence of gaps/separations, but seating/seal not verifiable from photo.

Recommendations:
- Replace filter with correct size, and consider a higher-efficiency filter if air quality demands.
- Clean the filter area/plenum to reduce dust buildup; ensure filter seats fully with a tight seal.
- Schedule regular HVAC maintenance to inspect duct leaks, overall airflow, and filtration effectiveness.
