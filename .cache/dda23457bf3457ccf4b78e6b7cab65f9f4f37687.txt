Location:
- Exterior side yard along blue vinyl‑siding wall under vented soffit

Observations:
- Blue horizontal vinyl siding; vented soffit/eaves
- Dual-head floodlight under eave; additional wall floodlight and junction box
- Surface wiring run along siding
- Piping/valves at grade; wall penetrations
- Propane cylinder on ground near wall
- Stacked materials/equipment, bags, bucket, weeds against wall; uneven bare soil

Potential Issues:
- Exposed/unsecured exterior wiring; sections not in conduit/weatherproof boxes (shock/moisture hazard)
- Propane cylinder stored against house and near electrical equipment; not on stable noncombustible base (fire/explosion risk)
- Vegetation/debris in contact with siding; inadequate clearance from soil (moisture retention/pest harborage)
- Gaps around wall penetrations; missing/failed sealant (water/pest entry)
- Access to valves/piping obstructed by storage (unsafe/blocked condition)
- Trip hazards from loose bucket/debris and uneven surface
- Possible poor drainage/soil contact at wall base (dark, damp area)

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed electrician secure/route exterior wiring in conduit with weatherproof boxes/covers; ensure GFCI protection; service/replace fixtures as needed
- Relocate and secure propane cylinder to a ventilated, level, noncombustible pad away from ignition sources and openings; inspect cylinder condition
- Remove stored items and trash; clear vegetation; maintain 6–8 in clearance between soil/plantings and siding
- Seal/flash around all wall penetrations with exterior-grade sealant/escutcheons
- Improve grading to slope away from foundation; keep area dry
- Maintain safe access to valves; correct trip hazards and organize storage
