Location:
- Exterior side yard along house wall under eave

Observations:
- Vinyl lap siding; perforated soffit panels; no gutters visible
- Dual-head motion floodlight at eave; additional wall-mounted floodlight
- Telecom/utility boxes with multiple surface cables on wall
- Pile of flexible duct/insulated material stacked on table
- Small propane cylinder near wall; yard clutter/debris; tall vegetation against siding

Potential Issues:
- Exposed/loose exterior wiring and cables; wall light appears fed without conduit/weatherproof box (improper wiring)
- Unsealed/poorly sealed cable penetrations at siding (gaps/voids; potential water intrusion and pest entry)
- Stored materials and vegetation tight to siding (conducive to moisture, decay, and pests)
- Propane cylinder stored adjacent to structure/ignition sources (fire safety concern)
- Debris and tipped bucket in walkway (trip/fall hazard)
- Access to wall utilities/valves obstructed by stored items
- Organic buildup/soil contact at base of wall (moisture/conducive condition)

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed electrician correct exterior wiring: install weatherproof boxes/fixtures and route cables in UV-rated conduit; secure all cables
- Seal all wall penetrations with exterior-grade sealant/boots
- Remove stored ducting/debris; maintain clear access to utilities
- Relocate propane cylinder to an approved outdoor location away from the house, openings, and ignition sources
- Trim vegetation back and maintain clearance; keep soil/mulch below siding and improve cleanliness/drainage in this area
- Clear trip hazards and keep service path unobstructed
