Location:
- Front exterior: driveway and front elevation of house

Observations:
- Single-lane concrete driveway; adjacent turf
- Asphalt shingle roof; horizontal lap siding; no gutters visible at eaves
- Oil/vehicle-fluid stain centered on driveway
- Multiple concrete cracks; map cracking; left edge broken/spalled with separation
- Vegetation encroaching along slab edges and into cracks

Potential Issues:
- Driveway cracks, edge spalling, and gaps/voids along left side
- Uneven/displaced areas at cracked edge create trip/fall hazard
- Oil/auto-fluid staining; possible slip hazard when wet and can deteriorate concrete
- No gutters/downspouts observed at front eave; roof runoff may discharge near foundation/driveway, promoting erosion/settlement

Recommendations:
- Grind/level uneven spots; patch/replace broken sections; seal all cracks
- Degrease/clean stain; apply concrete sealer after repairs
- Install gutters/downspouts with extensions to direct water away from house and driveway
- Trim/edge vegetation; keep joints and edges clear and sealed to limit water intrusion and further deterioration
