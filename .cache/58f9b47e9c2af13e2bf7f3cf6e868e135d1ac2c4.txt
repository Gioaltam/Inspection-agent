Location:
- Front exterior view; driveway and front elevation of single-story home

Observations:
- Concrete single-car driveway adjoining lawn
- Horizontal lap siding (blue); single-story structure
- Asphalt shingle roof visible
- Dark oil/grease stain mid-driveway
- Vehicles parked on driveway/yard

Potential Issues:
- Driveway: multiple cracks; significant edge crack with spalling/separation (left side)
- Driveway surface irregularities may present trip/fall hazard
- Open cracks/gaps allow water intrusion into slab/base
- Oil/grease staining on concrete; potential slip hazard when wet
- Roof shows dark streaking consistent with algae/mildew staining

Recommendations:
- Clean/degrease driveway; pressure wash as needed
- Seal/patch driveway cracks and spalled edges; consider resurfacing or slab leveling if unevenness persists
- Monitor driveway for further movement; repair to mitigate trip hazard
- Treat roof staining with manufacturer-approved cleaning; evaluate roof condition further if aging is suspected
- Trim/maintain vegetation encroaching at driveway edges
