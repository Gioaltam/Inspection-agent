Location:
- Exterior window, lower sash area and sill

Observations:
- Painted wood trim and white-painted brick rowlock sill
- Black metal insect screen with mesh; interior blinds behind
- Heavy paint build-up on trim/sill; dirt/debris on sill

Potential Issues:
- Screen frame appears misaligned/loose at bottom-left corner; small gap present (possible pest entry)
- Slight bow/warping noted along bottom rail of screen frame
- Paint chips/scuffs on sill/trim with minor substrate exposure
- Hairline cracks/irregular caulk at trim joints suggesting aged/failing sealant
- No visible water stains, rot, or corrosion

Recommendations:
- Reseat/secure screen; repair or replace bent/misaligned frame to close gaps
- Scrape loose paint, spot-prime exposed areas, re-caulk trim joints, and repaint for protection
- Clean debris from sill to promote drainage
- Monitor after rain for signs of water intrusion and address promptly if observed
