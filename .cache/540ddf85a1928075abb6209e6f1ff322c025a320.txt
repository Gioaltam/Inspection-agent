Location: Exterior lower wall/siding near foundation

What I See:
- Siding panels are broken/missing, exposing the black building paper.
- Loose, warped pieces of cladding around a surface-mounted conduit.

Issues to Address:
- Missing/damaged exterior cladding exposing the weather barrier; risk of moisture intrusion and pest entry.

Recommended Action:
- Remove loose pieces and inspect underlying sheathing/framing for moisture or rot.
- Replace damaged sections of siding and restore a continuous weather-resistive barrier with proper flashing.
- Finish/paint new materials and maintain adequate clearance to grade.
- Use a qualified siding contractor; repair any concealed damage found.
