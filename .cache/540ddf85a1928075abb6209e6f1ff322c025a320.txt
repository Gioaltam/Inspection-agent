Location: Exterior wall at foundation

What I See:
- Loose/broken siding panels with building paper exposed.
- Panel edges warped and not fastened; conduit running across the area.

Issues to Address:
- Damaged/detached siding exposing the weather barrier and lower wall.
- Missing/failed fastening and lack of proper bottom edge/flash detail; siding appears too close to grade.

Recommended Action:
- Remove loose material and inspect sheathing/framing for moisture damage; repair any rot.
- Replace siding panels and damaged weather barrier; install proper Z‑flashing/drip edge and maintain 6–8 inches clearance from soil.
- Refasten securely; seal and flash around any conduit penetrations.
- Prime and paint repaired area for protection.
