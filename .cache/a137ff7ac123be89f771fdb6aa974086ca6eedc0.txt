Location:
- Curbside residential mailbox at 904; front yard sidewalk/curb visible.

Observations:
- White-painted wooden post with cross-brace; metal mailbox mounted and slightly dented.
- Post shows weathering/peeling paint; base near ground appears exposed.
- A large rock is placed at the base ( ballast) instead of a proper concrete footing.
- Grass/weeds around the base; some soil/wood contact with ground.
- Red mail flag present; no obvious wiring or conduit.

Potential Issues:
- Possible wood rot or insect damage at ground line due to direct soil contact and peeling paint.
- Improper/alternative anchoring (rock ballast instead of concrete footing); risk of movement or failure.
- Loose or missing fasteners; visible holes along mounting area; potential rust.
- Mailbox appears dented; possible misalignment.

Recommendations:
- Replace or re-anchor post with proper footing (concrete) and ensure mailbox is plumb and at correct setback.
- Inspect and tighten/replace fasteners; treat wood and repaint to protect against moisture.
- Remove rock ballast; install proper post base/ground sleeve or anchor brackets.
- Check alignment and height per local code; ensure no water intrusion into wood.
