Location:
- Ceiling-mounted HVAC register/grille

Observations:
- Rectangular metal louvered register, painted white; two mounting screws
- Surrounding ceiling shows uneven/patchy finish
- Visible dust/soiling on louvers and inside duct opening
- Small perimeter gaps between register frame and ceiling in areas (not tightly seated)

Potential Issues:
- Dust/debris buildup on grille/interior, may reduce air quality/flow
- Perimeter gaps may allow air leakage, dust streaking, and minor pest entry
- No visible dents/bends, warping, cracks, misalignment, corrosion/rust, or water stains/leaks at time of photo

Recommendations:
- Remove and clean grille; vacuum accessible duct throat
- Reseat and secure register; seal perimeter to ceiling/boot with appropriate caulk/foam to limit air leakage
- Touch up ceiling finish/paint as desired after sealing
- Monitor for any moisture or staining that could indicate condensation or duct insulation issues
