Location:
- Exterior metal entry door, latch side near lockset and jamb

Observations:
- Painted steel door with keypad lockset
- Multiple paint blisters and flakes; bare metal visible
- Light surface pitting on door skin
- Weatherstripping/gasket at jamb appears worn/compressed
- Minor finish wear/corrosion on lock trim

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at numerous spots; substrate metal exposed
- Failed/peeling paint and coating
- Possible gap at latch side due to deteriorated weatherstripping (potential water/air/pest entry)
- Rough/flaking areas could create sharp edges

Recommendations:
- Scrape/sand rust, treat with rust converter, prime with rust‑inhibiting primer, and repaint
- Replace/adjust weatherstripping to ensure full perimeter seal
- Inspect for moisture intrusion around door and repair/caulk as needed
- Service or replace corroded lock trim if sticking or deteriorated
- If corrosion is advanced or door skin is thin, consider door replacement
- If dwelling built before 1978, use lead‑safe practices/testing before disturbing paint
