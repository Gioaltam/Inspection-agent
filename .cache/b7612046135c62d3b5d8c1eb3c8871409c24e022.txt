Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet and surrounding counter

Observations:
- Painted wood cabinet with two doors below counter
- Left door visibly misaligned; interior visible through opening
- Paint worn/peeling; chipped edges with raw wood exposed
- Bottom edges of doors appear swollen/deformed
- Surface stains/discoloration on doors and cabinet face
- Counter/backsplash joint and counter edge show rough/worn areas
- Gap/opening at toe-kick/side near floor
- Mop bucket with water and mop stored in front

Potential Issues:
- Warping/swelling of cabinet doors from moisture exposure
- Cracks/chips and failed paint with substrate exposure
- Gaps/separations at door edges and cabinet frame; door misalignment
- Likely loose/missing/failed hinges or fasteners
- Water staining on doors; potential past/current leak or splash damage
- Open gaps at toe-kick/around doors may allow pest entry
- Slip hazard from mop/bucket water on floor

Recommendations:
- Adjust/repair hinges; realign doors; replace missing/failed hardware
- Sand/prime/paint or replace damaged cabinet faces; seal exposed wood
- Inspect under-sink plumbing for leaks; repair and dry area; add drip tray if needed
- Reseal sink rim and counter/backsplash joints with kitchen-grade silicone
- Seal gaps at toe-kick and cabinet frame to deter pests
- Keep area dry; remove/contain mop water; clean surfaces regularly
