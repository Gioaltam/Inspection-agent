Location:
- Kitchen sink/counter and base cabinet area

Observations:
- Painted wood base cabinet with two doors; white countertop; stainless sink
- Heavy surface wear on doors/face; chipped/peeling paint and discoloration
- Large gap at top of left door; door not closing flush
- Raw/unfinished wood exposed at cabinet edges and toe-kick/right side cutout
- Wall/backsplash area shows peeling/unfinished surface
- Mop bucket and handle placed in front of cabinet

Potential Issues:
- Misalignment/loose cabinet doors; large gap/void at top
- Warping/swelling and delamination of cabinet wood; substrate exposure
- Cracks/chips and failed/missing paint/sealant on cabinet and counter edges
- Water stains on doors; potential water intrusion from sink/under-sink plumbing
- Open voids at cabinet base/right side; potential pest entry points
- Missing/loose door hardware (right door lacks handle)
- Blocked/unsafe condition and trip hazard from mop/bucket in walkway

Recommendations:
- Adjust/repair or replace door hinges; realign doors to close properly
- Replace damaged cabinet panels/doors; sand/prime and repaint; seal all exposed wood
- Install/secure door hardware
- Inspect under-sink plumbing for active leaks; repair as needed; dry and treat moisture-damaged areas
- Seal/patch gaps at cabinet base and right side; pest-proof openings
- Clean and recaulk/seal counter-to-wall and sink perimeters
- Repair/paint backsplash/wall; consider durable backsplash install
- Remove/store mop and bucket to maintain safe, unobstructed access and dry flooring
