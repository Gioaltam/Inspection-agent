Location:
- Exterior side elevation (gable wall), yard bed along foundation

Observations:
- Horizontal vinyl siding; painted wood soffit/fascia; no gutters visible
- Loose cables draped down wall
- Dense vegetation/groundcover against siding; soil/mulch bed at foundation
- Grill and stored items placed against wall

Potential Issues:
- Unsecured cables on wall; unsupported and not in conduit; damage/shock risk if energized
- Vegetation in contact with siding; moisture retention and pest harborage; blocks inspection
- Peeling/dirty paint and discoloration at soffit/fascia; possible moisture staining; wood exposure risk
- Stored items/grill against siding; combustible clearance concern and trip/blocked access hazard
- Rain runoff likely concentrates at base (no gutters observed); splashback/erosion and moisture at foundation

Recommendations:
- Have qualified electrician/low-voltage tech secure/route cables with proper supports/conduit or remove unused lines
- Trim/remove vegetation; maintain clearance to siding; ensure soil slopes away from foundation
- Clean, scrape, prime, and repaint soffit/fascia; evaluate for moisture source; repair any damaged wood; consider installing/repairing gutters and downspouts
- Relocate grill and debris away from wall; keep area clear for access
- After clearing, inspect siding/foundation for hidden damage; seal any gaps as needed
