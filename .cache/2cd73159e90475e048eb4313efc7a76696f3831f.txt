Location:
- Water heater in interior utility/closet area (adjacent to wall/baseboard)

Observations:
- Electric tank-style water heater; gray jacket; side element access panel
- Sits directly on concrete floor; no drain pan visible
- Loose pole/pipe stored leaning against tank front
- Light staining on floor near base; slight discoloration at bottom tank ring

Potential Issues:
- Stored item leaning on tank blocks access; tip/fall hazard; unsafe working clearance
- No drain pan observed; increased risk of water damage if leak occurs
- Staining and slight corrosion at base suggest past moisture; potential early rusting

Recommendations:
- Remove stored items; maintain clear working space around heater
- Install drip pan with drain or leak detector/auto-shutoff as applicable
- Check for active leaks at base and fittings; clean and treat any corrosion
- Verify TPR valve and discharge piping are present and properly routed to an approved drain (not visible in photo)
- Review age/service history; have unit evaluated if corrosion progresses
