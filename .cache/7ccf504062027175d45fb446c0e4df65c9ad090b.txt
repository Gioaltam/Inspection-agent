Location:
- Under-kitchen-sink cabinet at garbage disposal and drain assembly

Observations:
- Black garbage disposal unit; white PVC trap; braided supply line
- Corrugated gray dishwasher drain hose routed low
- Plastic tray with standing/dirty water beneath disposal
- Cabinet floor shows discoloration and swelling/delamination

Potential Issues:
- Active leak present (standing water under disposal)
- Water stains and cabinet base swelling/warping; possible mildew growth
- Dishwasher drain hose lacks visible high loop/air gap; sagging lowâ€”backflow risk

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber locate and repair leak (disposal, sink flange, or drain fittings as needed)
- Dry area promptly; clean/disinfect; replace/repair damaged cabinet base as required
- Re-route dishwasher drain with proper high loop or air gap
- Consider leak detector and a waterproof liner/pan under sink
- Monitor for ongoing moisture; evaluate for mold remediation if growth persists
