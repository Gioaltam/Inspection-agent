Location:
- Outdoor AC condenser, top grille/fan area

Observations:
- Metal louvered top with axial fan below
- Field wire splice using pink crimp/heat‑shrink connector
- Protective wire sleeve/insulation torn/frayed and charred
- Wiring routed over/through grille, unsecured
- Surface rust on fasteners and fan motor hub
- Vegetation close to unit

Potential Issues:
- Damaged/charred wire insulation and sleeve; substrate conductor potentially exposed
- Weather‑exposed field splice not in a junction box; risk of water intrusion/corrosion
- Wiring not in conduit and not secured; abrasion through grille and pull‑in hazard to moving fan
- Corrosion/rust on components indicating ongoing weathering
- Vegetation encroachment may restrict airflow and service access

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed HVAC technician evaluate/repair wiring; replace damaged conductors and sleeve
- Relocate/secure wiring away from fan path; protect in UV/weather‑rated conduit; place splices in a listed enclosure
- Inspect entire condenser for additional heat or electrical damage and test operation
- Clean/treat rusty fasteners; replace if weakened
- Trim vegetation to maintain proper clearance around unit
