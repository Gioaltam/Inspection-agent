Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit – top fan grille area

Observations:
- Metal top grille with visible fan motor beneath
- Electrical wires routed through grille opening; mid-wire splice with pink crimp connector
- Outer jacket/tape around splice torn and frayed; insulation appears compromised
- Splice not enclosed in a junction box/conduit; unsecured on top of unit
- Rusted/oxidized fasteners on grille/fan motor
- Vegetation growing close to unit

Potential Issues:
- Improper wiring/missing conduit: exposed, weather‑unprotected splice on exterior
- Insulation damage/failed wrap at splice; potential exposed conductors
- Water intrusion risk to electrical connection; shock/fire hazard
- Wire unsecured and routed through guard opening; could contact fan blades (unsafe condition)
- Corrosion on fasteners may weaken attachment
- Vegetation encroachment may restrict airflow

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed HVAC/electrician repair wiring: replace damaged conductors, relocate splice inside approved junction box, use proper weather‑rated connectors and conduit; secure routing away from fan
- Restore full insulation/heat‑shrink and strain relief on all conductors
- Replace corroded fasteners as needed; inspect fan guard/motor mounts
- Clear vegetation; maintain recommended clearance around unit (typically 12–24 in.) and schedule full condenser service/inspection
