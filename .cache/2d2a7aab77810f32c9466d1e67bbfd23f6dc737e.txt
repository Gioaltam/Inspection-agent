Location:
- Interior steel entry door for unit 100 (appears to be a stairwell/corridor access).

Observations:
- Green-painted, metal door with numbers “100.”
- Electronic keypad lock on the left side; door knob below.
- Small peephole in the center of the door.
- Overhead door closer-type apparatus with a long arm/hold-open strap attached to the ceiling (mounted across the top of the door).
- Patch of chipped paint on the left edge of the frame.
- Hinges visible on the right side; frame and wall painted light green.

Potential Issues:
- Hold-open strap/arm mounted to ceiling could be non-code compliant or unsafe if not tied to an approved fire alarm system or properly installed; risk of sudden release or bracket failure.
- Chipped paint on the jamb may indicate bare metal exposure and potential rust/water intrusion if not addressed.
- Overall hardware appears aged; potential looseness of screws or misalignment could affect security and proper latching.

Recommendations:
- Have the hold-open device and mounting inspected by a qualified door hardware technician; verify compliance and proper operation (consider removing or replacing with an approved UL-listed hold-open linked to fire alarm if applicable).
- Repair/repaint chipped jamb area to protect against corrosion and moisture.
- Check door alignment, tighten screws, and ensure proper latching with the strike plate; confirm door closes fully without binding.
- Verify keypad lock operation and maintenance; replace or upgrade hardware if reliability is in question.
