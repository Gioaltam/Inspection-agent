Location:
- Interior wall near ceiling; louvered HVAC grille/register

Observations:
- Metal louvered grille, surface-mounted with four screws
- Textured drywall/ceiling; linear seam visible at ceiling line above grille
- Grille face appears clean; no visible rust or staining

Potential Issues:
- Ceiling drywall seam crack/separation along joint line above grille (possible tape failure or minor movement)

Recommendations:
- Patch/retape/mud and repaint the cracked ceiling seam; monitor for recurrence
- If cracking returns, have a drywall/structure specialist evaluate for movement or humidity issues
- Clean grille periodically and confirm it is secure; replace/inspect filter if this is a return air location
