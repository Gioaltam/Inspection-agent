Location:
- Interior wall near ceiling; HVAC return/supply grille above a doorway/soffit

Observations:
- White painted, textured drywall at wall/ceiling junction
- Rectangular metal louvered grille; two visible mounting screws; appears clean and free of rust
- Linear seam visible along ceiling near grille

Potential Issues:
- Drywall ceiling joint shows linear crack/separation along tape seam; minor texture delamination/gaps present

Recommendations:
- Re-tape/bed cracked ceiling joint; patch, retexture, and repaint
- Monitor for recurrence; if cracking returns, have the area evaluated for movement or humidity issues
- Inspect around/behind grille for any gaps at the duct boot and seal with mastic/caulk if found
- Clean grille periodically and verify return filter maintenance schedule
