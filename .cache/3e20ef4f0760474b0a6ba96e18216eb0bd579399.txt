Location:
- Ceiling vent/grille in interior ceiling.

Observations:
- White square vent with five horizontal slats; screws visible on sides.
- Light staining/discoloration around the vent on the ceiling.
- Small gaps/misalignment at the vent frame; minor paint/chipping near the perimeter.
- Dust/dirt on slats; no visible rust.

Potential Issues:
- Possible moisture intrusion (stain) near vent; potential mold risk if damp.
- Perimeter gap and exposed seal area; potential air leakage.
- Dust accumulation indicating reduced airflow if clogged.

Recommendations:
- Inspect for moisture source (roof/plumbing) and repair if needed.
- Clean vent and assess for mold; treat/replace if mold present.
- Re-seal perimeter with appropriate caulk; repaint as needed.
- Inspect vent frame and fasteners; replace if loose or corroded.
