Location:
- Bathroom – vanity/sink, wall mirror, right-side electrical outlet

Observations:
- Cultured marble top with integral basin and short backsplash
- Large unframed wall mirror held by metal clips
- Two-handle faucet; no visible sink stopper
- Louvered medicine-cabinet door open
- Standard duplex outlet at right; charger plugged in; cord draped over vanity
- Tile floor; vanity cabinet with laminate doors
- Countertop cluttered; surface staining/residue present

Potential Issues:
- Outlet near sink appears non-GFCI (no test/reset buttons) – shock hazard
- Powered device cord hanging across sink – unsafe around water; shock/entanglement risk
- Gaps/lack of sealant at vanity-to-wall/backsplash joints – moisture intrusion risk
- Corrosion/staining at drain flange and around basin – possible leak/ongoing moisture

Recommendations:
- Replace bathroom receptacle with GFCI-protected outlet and test/reset
- Keep cords and powered devices away from the sink; use only with GFCI protection
- Clean and sanitize countertop/basin; remove residues
- Reseal with mildew-resistant caulk at counter-to-wall and backsplash joints; seal around faucet/penetrations
- Inspect faucet and drain for leaks; replace corroded parts and install/repair sink stopper if needed
- Verify mirror is securely fastened; add proper clips/adhesive if loose
