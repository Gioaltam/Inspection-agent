Location:
- Side yard along the house, adjacent to a chain-link fence. Exterior wall is light stucco/paint. Outdoor faucet on wall; concrete steps at door area. Large tree and tall grasses near fence.

Observations:
- Patchy, uneven lawn with several brown dead patches.
- Tall ornamental grasses growing close to the fence and foundation area.
- Large tree with overhanging branches near the structure; overhead utility lines visible.
- Fence appears intact; no obvious gate visible in this view.
- No visible water stains or obvious wall damage from this angle.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with foundation/toward wall (moisture/pest ingress risk).
- Overhanging branches near power lines (safety risk; potential branch failure or electrical hazards).
- Patchy lawn suggests irrigation/drainage issues or soil health concerns; possible standing water or compacted soil.
- No visible structural cracks, but limited view of wall; potential unseen gaps/sealant issues near ground.

Recommendations:
- Trim back grasses and remove vegetation within 12 inches of the siding; maintain clearances around the foundation.
- Prune tree branches away from the house and lines; consider professional assessment if limbs are decayed or too close to utilities.
- Evaluate irrigation and grading to improve drainage away from the foundation; reseed/re-sod brown areas as needed.
- Inspect exterior for cracks, gaps, or deteriorated sealant near the base and around penetrations; apply caulk/sealant as appropriate.
- Inspect chain-link fence posts for stability and gate alignment; repair as needed.
