Location:
- Side yard along the exterior wall of the house (blue vinyl siding), near utility equipment and a shed in the background.

Observations:
- Exterior lighting: two round fixtures and a motion/sensor unit mounted on the wall.
- Electrical: wall-mounted box with exposed conduit/cords.
- Propane: upright propane cylinder/torpedo near ground.
- Storage: large coils or rolled insulating/duct material stacked on a small platform/table.
- Ground clutter: white bag, miscellaneous debris, orange bucket on grass; overgrown weeds along the wall.
- Ground uneven with a mix of soil and concrete debris.

Potential Issues:
- Propane cylinder stored very close to the building and other clutter; potential ignition/source risk.
- Clutter and stacked materials against the siding may trap moisture and harbor pests; restricts access to utilities.
- Exposed or poorly protected exterior electrical connections/cords (weather exposure, potential for damage).
- Trip hazards from hoses/cords and uneven ground.
- Vegetation growing against the siding could retain moisture or pests.

Recommendations:
- Relocate and secure the propane cylinder upright in a proper, outdoor-rated storage area, away from the building; cap/valve protection when not in use.
- Remove or relocate clutter; store materials on pallets or inside a shed, ensuring minimum clearances from the siding (preferably 18â€“36 inches if possible) for ventilation and maintenance access.
- Upgrade/secure exterior electrical outlets and cords; use weatherproof covers, proper conduit, and strain relief; keep cords off the ground.
- Trim/remove overgrown weeds; maintain at least a gap between vegetation and siding to reduce moisture and pest entry.
- Regularly inspect for leaks, corrosion, or damage to gas lines and electrical components; ensure proper drainage and no standing water near the foundation.
