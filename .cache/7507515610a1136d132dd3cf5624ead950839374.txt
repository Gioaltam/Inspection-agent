Location:
- Exterior, garage door opening at front/side elevation

Observations:
- Stucco exterior wall with gable eave/soffit
- Sectional metal garage door within framed opening; concrete slab threshold
- Perimeter trim/weatherstripping appears minimal/absent
- Grass/soil up to slab; no paved driveway/apron
- Debris/wood cabinets piled left of door and in front of opening

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids around door perimeter; missing/failed caulk and weatherstripping
- Door appears undersized/misaligned in opening; uneven reveals
- Bottom seal not tight to slab; possible water entry at threshold
- Stucco cracks/chips at jamb edges
- Debris obstructing doorway; trip/fall hazard and blocked access
- Wood debris and vegetation near structure create pest entry/harborage potential
- Lack of visible head flashing above door may allow water intrusion

Recommendations:
- Have a garage door contractor realign/resize door, adjust tracks, and install proper weatherstripping
- Seal/caulk perimeter; install head flashing/drip cap; repair stucco cracks and repaint
- Improve drainage: add driveway/apron or threshold curb; ensure bottom seal contacts slab
- Remove debris and stored wood; clear vegetation away from wall; monitor for pests
- General exterior cleaning and touch-up as needed
