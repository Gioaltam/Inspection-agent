Location:
- Under-sink cabinet area (lavatory/kitchen)

Observations:
- ABS vertical sink tailpiece; white slip-joint fitting
- No P-trap or trap arm connected to wall drain
- Wall drain stub-out/adapter visible at back
- Two angle-stop valves with braided supply lines
- Tile back/wall with rough patches; missing/gritty grout/caulk
- Cabinet base shows discoloration/staining and debris
- Unsecured black cable/wire hanging in cabinet

Potential Issues:
- Missing P-trap/connection to wall drain—sewer gas risk; sink not functional
- Possible open/uncapped drain stub—pest entry and odor pathway
- Water stains on cabinet base—possible prior/ongoing leaks; potential mold/mildew
- Gaps/voids and failed/missing sealant around penetrations and tiles—moisture/pest entry
- Oxidation/corrosion visible on shutoff valves—leak potential
- Unsecured/unknown cable under sink—potential improper wiring/unsafe near moisture
- Substrate exposure/damage at cabinet base from moisture

Recommendations:
- Licensed plumber to install correct P-trap and trap arm to wall; cap drain until completed; leak-test
- Seal around all penetrations; repair/re-grout and caulk tiles
- Clean, dry, and sanitize cabinet; remove/replace any water-damaged/moldy materials; consider lining/sealing base
- Inspect/replace corroded shutoff valves and aged supply lines; check for active leaks
- Identify and properly secure/terminate any wiring; have electrician correct if electrical
