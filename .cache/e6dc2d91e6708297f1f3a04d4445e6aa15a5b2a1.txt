Location:
- Kitchen base cabinets under the sink.

Observations:
- White-painted cabinet doors show heavy paint wear, scuffs, and chipping.
- Bottom edges and between doors have exposed wood and dark staining.
- Doors appear misaligned with gaps; one door slightly separated.
- Cabinet hardware shows rust/dark corrosion.
- No obvious moisture stain on countertop; possible moisture exposure at cabinet faces.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected water damage/rot in lower cabinet substrates due to peeling paint and staining.
- Substrate exposure and potential mold risk with ongoing moisture.
- Rusty hardware and potential fastener wear; misalignment may indicate loose hinges.
- Possible gaps around sink edge/back panel allowing water ingress.

Recommendations:
- Inspect under-sink plumbing for leaks and fix any leaks; replace damaged panels if rot is found.
- Re-seal with waterproof caulk around sink/top edges; refresh finish on cabinets (paint/reface).
- Realign doors or replace hardware; tighten/repair hinges as needed.
- Consider cabinet replacement if rot is extensive; address moisture source and improve ventilation.
