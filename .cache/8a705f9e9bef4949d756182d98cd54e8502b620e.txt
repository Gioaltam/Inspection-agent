Location:
- Exterior entry door area; view of door jamb and bottom threshold.

Observations:
- Door surface dirty with dark staining at lower half.
- Paint peeling/chipping heavily on trim and jamb; exposed substrate.
- Gap visible between door edge and frame near bottom; light intrusion possible.
- Brass knob shows tarnish; edge/strike area with chipped paint and possible rust.

Potential Issues:
- Deteriorating paint (potential lead paint risk if home built before 1978) and substrate exposure.
- Moisture intrusion risk from bottom gap; possible wood rot or corrosion in jamb/edge.
- Inadequate weather sealing (worn weatherstripping/door sweep).

Recommendations:
- Inspect jamb for rot; repair/replace damaged trim or jamb as needed.
- Repaint and seal trim/jamb with exterior-grade coating; address any corrosion on hardware.
- Install or replace weatherstripping and door sweep; adjust door for proper closure to eliminate gap.
- Consider lead-paint assessment if applicable; address accordingly.
