Location:
- Exterior wall window under eave/trim band

Observations:
- Small vinyl horizontal slider with insect screen
- Textured stucco cladding; painted wood/fiber-cement trim band above
- Perimeter caulk present around frame
- Hairline stucco cracks visible below and at sides of window

Potential Issues:
- Failed/missing sealant: cracking/separation at window-to-stucco joints, especially top corners and jambs
- Gaps at joint where upper trim band meets stucco above window
- Stucco cracks around perimeter and horizontal seam below window
- No visible head flashing/drip cap above window; potential for water intrusion (not verified)
- Minor staining/soiling at head joint suggests moisture collection

Recommendations:
- Remove and replace deteriorated perimeter caulk with high-quality exterior sealant; tool for continuous seal
- Seal/flash the trim-to-stucco joint; verify proper head flashing/drip cap above window and add if absent
- Repair stucco cracks and any loose areas; patch, seal, and repaint
- Monitor interior around window for leaks; have a qualified contractor evaluate if moisture is detected
