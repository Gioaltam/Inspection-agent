Location:
- Bathroom ceiling above wavy wall panel/tile (near shower/tub area)

Observations:
- Painted drywall ceiling; metal louvered vent/register with two screws
- Noticeable dust accumulation on vent louvers and inside grille
- Wavy wall panels/tiles with vertical seam; white caulk bead visible
- Slight shadow line at vent perimeter and at ceiling-to-wall joint

Potential Issues:
- Dust/debris buildup on vent may restrict airflow/ventilation
- Minor gaps at vent perimeter and at ceiling-to-wall joint (possible air/moisture leakage, dirt streaking)
- Caulk at vertical panel seam appears uneven with small separations; potential moisture entry if in wet zone

Recommendations:
- Clean vent grille and duct opening; verify fan operation and airflow to exterior
- Seal vent perimeter to ceiling if gaps confirmed (paintable caulk)
- Remove and re-caulk vertical seam and ceiling-to-wall junction with mildew-resistant silicone if within the shower area
- Monitor for recurring discoloration; if moisture persists, further evaluate for condensation or leaks
