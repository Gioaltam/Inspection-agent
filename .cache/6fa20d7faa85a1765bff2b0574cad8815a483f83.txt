Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit (Tempstar) mounted on concrete pad beside house siding.

Observations:
- Cabinet fins appear dirty/dusty.
- Top fan guard shows some rust/ corrosion.
- Vegetation growing around base; grass up against and touching the cabinet.
- Unit seems quite close to the wall/vertical siding on the right side.
- Pad looks intact but has surrounding weed/soil buildup.

Potential Issues:
- Inadequate clearance to siding and around unit (restricted airflow/service access).
- Vegetation/trash at base could trap moisture and promote rust or pest entry.
- Dirt/debris on condenser coil reduces efficiency and may indicate insufficient maintenance.
- Rust/corrosion on top edge of cabinet (material degradation over time).
- Unknown condition of electrical disconnect/wiring (not visible in photo).

Recommendations:
- Increase clearance around the unit (minimum 12 inches side, more if possible; keep 36 inches above if feasible) and trim/remove nearby vegetation.
- Clean condenser coil and cabinet surfaces; remove debris and rinse with appropriate cleaner.
- Inspect and address rust; treat or repaint affected areas; consider cabinet replacement if corrosion is extensive.
- Have a qualified HVAC tech inspect electrical connections and the service disconnect; verify refrigerant charge and overall system operation.
- Check concrete pad for level and lift if unsettled; remove grass/soil buildup to improve drainage.
