Location:
- HVAC air handler/furnace cabinet – return/filter opening

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with warning labels; disposable pleated filter labeled 18x18x1
- Filter inserted diagonally; opening edges show old cloth/duct tape
- Exposed return cavity with dust/debris; condensate PVC piping visible below
- Small low‑voltage wire present inside return area along side wall

Potential Issues:
- Filter bent/warped and misaligned; likely wrong size
- Large gaps/voids around filter; missing/loose filter rack cover/panel
- Failed tape/sealant at opening; unsealed seams causing air bypass
- Dust accumulation inside return; potential for unfiltered air to coil/ducts
- Unsecured low‑voltage wire in return plenum; potential improper installation (not in conduit/plenum‑rated unknown)
- Possible pest entry via unsealed return opening

Recommendations:
- Install correct‑size filter and proper filter rack/door; ensure tight fit and airflow arrow correct
- Seal all joints/openings with HVAC mastic or UL‑181 foil tape; remove/replace deteriorated cloth/duct tape
- Clean return cavity and service coil/ducts as needed due to bypassed dust
- Secure/route low‑voltage wiring per code (plenum‑rated cable or conduit); have HVAC technician evaluate
- Set routine filter replacement schedule and document size on cabinet
