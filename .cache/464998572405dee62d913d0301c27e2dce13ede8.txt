Location:
- Kitchen: upper cabinets, countertop/backsplash, electric range with vent hood, ceiling

Observations:
- Painted wood cabinets with open shelves; aged finish
- Laminate countertop with wood edge; seam at wall lacks visible caulk
- Electric glass-top range; under-cabinet vent hood present; visible grease residue
- Standard duplex receptacle at backsplash (no test/reset buttons visible)
- Popcorn/textured ceiling with dark spotting
- Cabinet hardware/handles aged; some corrosion

Potential Issues:
- Cabinet doors misaligned/warped; one door not closing flush; hinges likely loose
- Peeling/chipped paint with exposed wood/substrate on cabinet faces/drawer fronts
- Corrosion/rust on cabinet handles
- Grease buildup on hood/cabinets near cooktop (fire hazard)
- Countertop edge wear/chipping; open seams; failed/missing caulk at backsplash (moisture entry risk)
- No visible GFCI protection at countertop receptacle (shock hazard)
- Gaps/separations at cabinet joints/around doors (potential pest entry points)
- Dark staining on ceiling finish above cabinets (possible moisture/soot accumulation)

Recommendations:
- Clean/degrease hood, filters, and adjacent cabinets; service/replace filter/hood as needed
- Adjust/secure or replace cabinet hinges; realign doors; replace damaged/warped components
- Refinish or reface cabinets; replace corroded hardware
- Repair/replace damaged countertop edging; re-caulk/seal counter-to-wall joints
- Have a licensed electrician provide GFCI protection for all kitchen countertop receptacles
- Seal gaps/penetrations at cabinets to deter pests
- Clean and monitor ceiling staining; if moisture is suspected, locate and correct source before repainting
