Location:
- Kitchen: upper cabinets, countertop, range/hood area

Observations:
- Older painted wood cabinets with open shelves and hinged doors
- Dark laminate/wood countertop; electric range with hood
- Popcorn-textured ceiling/soffit above cabinets
- Duplex receptacle at backsplash; small appliances on counter
- No dedicated backsplash; painted wall behind counter

Potential Issues:
- Cabinet doors misaligned; gaps at closures; possible loose hinges
- Finish/paint heavily worn on cabinet faces/edges; substrate exposed
- Rust/corrosion on cabinet handle hardware
- Countertop and drawer/door edges chipped/worn; possible delamination/swelling
- Grease/grime staining on cabinets/hood area
- Ceiling/soffit discoloration and seam separations; potential prior moisture
- Countertop receptacle appears non-GFCI (no test/reset); shock hazard near sink/cooking
- Housekeeping/clutter close to cooktop creates burn/fire risk

Recommendations:
- Adjust/repair or replace cabinet hinges/doors; realign; replace corroded hardware
- Refinish/paint/seal cabinets; repair or replace deteriorated faces/edges
- Repair/replace damaged countertop edges; seal exposed substrate
- Install a washable backsplash; caulk/seal counter-to-wall junction
- Clean/degrease cabinets and hood; service/verify hood exhaust operation
- Evaluate ceiling/soffit stains for active leaks; repair and repaint after cause corrected
- Upgrade kitchen countertop outlets to GFCI (AFCI/GFCI as required); test protection
- Maintain safe clearances around cooktop; store chemicals/combustibles elsewhere
