Location:
- Exterior side wall along paver walkway near equipment stand/AC line set

Observations:
- Painted lap siding; minor paint chip visible
- Paver surface with leaves/debris
- Loose cords/cables on ground; white cord joined to black cable via small plastic terminal/connector
- Bucket with liquid adjacent
- HVAC line-set with taped insulation entering wall area

Potential Issues:
- Improper wiring: exposed splice/connector not in weatherproof junction box; no conduit/strain relief; likely not outdoor‑rated
- Shock/trip hazard: loose cords on ground and near bucket of liquid
- Line‑set insulation appears deteriorated/taped with gaps
- Minor paint loss on siding exposing substrate in a small spot

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed electrician remove makeshift splice and install a proper weatherproof junction box/connector or reroute wiring with outdoor‑rated cable and GFCI protection
- Secure/elevate cords; avoid routing near liquids; remove trip hazards
- Replace/repair HVAC line‑set insulation and seal wall penetration as needed
- Touch up paint where chipped; monitor siding for further wear
- Clean debris from pavers and maintain clear access along wall/equipment
