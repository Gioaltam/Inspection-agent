Location:
- Interior ceiling return-air (filter) grille

Observations:
- Metal louvered return grille with hinged/latch door
- Pleated filter visible (approx. 16x16x1)
- Noticeable dust/debris on louvers and filter media
- Small round hole in drywall above grille
- Minor gap visible between grille frame and drywall

Potential Issues:
- Dirty/clogged filter restricting airflow; reduced efficiency/comfort; added blower strain
- Dust buildup on grille indicates overdue cleaning and possible air bypass; indoor air quality concern
- Gaps at grille perimeter may draw air from wall/ceiling cavity (bypass leakage)
- Unsealed drywall hole: air leakage and potential pest entry point

Recommendations:
- Replace filter with correct size/MERV; set regular change schedule
- Clean grille and surrounding area
- Seal perimeter between grille frame and drywall (caulk or gasket) and ensure grille is secure/flush
- Patch/seal the drywall hole; repaint as needed
- If airflow issues persist, have HVAC technician evaluate return duct and plenum for additional leaks or restrictions
