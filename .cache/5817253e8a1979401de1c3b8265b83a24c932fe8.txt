Location:
- Kitchen area, upper cabinet run against wall beneath popcorn ceiling.

Observations:

- Gap/separation at top edge of cabinet run; exposed trim piece shows staining.
- Brown staining along wall/ceiling seam above cabinets.
- Limited view of hardware; some rust/dirt on edge areas; no active wiring visible.

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion indicated by brown staining at wall/ceiling joint.

- Re-seal joints with appropriate caulk/sealant; re-secure loose trim and reseat cabinet gaps.
- Repaint/refinish affected cabinet surfaces after repairs.
- Consider professional assessment if moisture/mold is suspected to ensure complete remediation.
