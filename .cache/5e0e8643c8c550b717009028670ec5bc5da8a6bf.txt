Location:
- Front exterior facade, roofline, driveway, entry steps

Observations:
- One-story brick veneer house; asphalt-shingle gable roof with gable vent
- Concrete driveway and small front stoop/steps; no visible gutters/downspouts
- Double-hung style windows; wood privacy fence left side
- Exterior light at entry; trash bin near front wall

Potential Issues:
- Driveway: multiple cracks, surface spalling, and some uneven areas—trip hazard
- Front steps/stoop: no handrail/guard at steps (2–3 risers)—fall hazard
- Roof: shingles appear aged with discoloration/granule loss; localized disturbance/debris visible near ridge—possible damage
- Drainage: lack of gutters/downspouts may cause splashback/erosion and moisture at foundation
- No visible corrosion, leaks/stains, mold/mildew, exposed wiring, or obvious pest entry points from this vantage

Recommendations:
- Repair/level and seal driveway; monitor and address any settlement creating trip hazards
- Install code-compliant handrail/guard at entry steps; ensure secure, even treads/risers
- Have a licensed roofer evaluate; repair any damaged shingles and remove debris; plan for replacement if near end of life
- Add gutters with properly directed downspouts/splash blocks to divert water away from foundation
- Clean pressure-wash driveway/stoop to improve traction
- Inspect and renew exterior caulk/sealant at windows/doors as needed
