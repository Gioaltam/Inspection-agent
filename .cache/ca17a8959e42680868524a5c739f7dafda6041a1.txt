Location: Exterior window and wall below

What I See:
- Aluminum windows with security bars; frames generally intact.
- Exterior electrical receptacle below the window has no cover/plate.

Issues to Address:
- Exterior receptacle missing a weatherproof, in-use cover and faceplate (exposed to moisture; shock hazard).
- Visible caulk/sealant gaps at lower window joints, including a small opening at the bottom-right corner of the right window.

Recommended Action:
- Install a code-compliant weatherproof in-use cover and gasketed faceplate; verify the circuit is GFCI-protected and the box is secure.
- Clean and reseal the window frame joints and perimeter with exterior-grade sealant; close any openings to prevent water intrusion.
