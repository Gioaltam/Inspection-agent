Location:
- HVAC return plenum/filter rack

Observations:
- Pleated 14x18x1 filter installed in metal rack
- Filter media heavily loaded with dust/debris; frame slightly bowed
- Filter sits slightly skewed in rack
- Significant dust/debris and insulation fibers on plenum floor
- Galvanized metal surfaces show light oxidation

Potential Issues:
- Severely clogged filter restricting airflow (efficiency/comfort strain; possible coil icing/overheating)
- Air bypass likely at filter edges due to poor fit/misalignment (gaps/voids)
- Accumulated debris in return may migrate to blower/coil, reducing performance
- Minor surface corrosion on metal components
- No visible water stains, cracks, mold/mildew, wiring issues, or pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Replace filter immediately with correct size (14x18x1); orient airflow arrow correctly; set 1â€“3 month replacement schedule
- Clean return plenum and surrounding ductwork; vacuum and wipe surfaces
- Improve seal around filter rack (gasket/foam or mastic/UL-181 foil tape) to eliminate bypass; ensure snug fit and alignment
- Have HVAC technician inspect blower/evaporator coil and verify static pressure/airflow after cleaning
