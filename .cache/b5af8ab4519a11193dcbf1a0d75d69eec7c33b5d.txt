Location: Front entry step/landing

What I See:
- Surface coating is peeling with multiple spalled patches exposing underlying concrete.
- Hairline surface cracking and pitting around the worn spots.

Issues to Address:
- Concrete surface delamination/spalling and peeling coating.

Recommended Action:
- Scrape/grind all loose material back to sound concrete.
- Patch spalled areas with a polymer‑modified concrete repair mortar; fill hairline cracks as needed.
- Resurface the landing/step with an exterior concrete resurfacer and apply a non‑slip sealer.
- Complete within routine maintenance timeframe to prevent further deterioration.
