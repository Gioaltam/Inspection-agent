Location: Front entry stoop/step

What I See:
- Surface coating has failed with multiple spalled/pitted areas.
- Hairline cracks radiating from pits; worn finish on tread.

Issues to Address:
- Concrete surface spalling/delamination on the tread.
- Multiple cracks and rough edges that could become a trip hazard and worsen with moisture.

Recommended Action:
- Remove all loose/failed coating and weak concrete; clean thoroughly.
- Patch spalled spots with a polymerâ€‘modified concrete repair mortar; trowel smooth.
- Route and fill cracks with exterior concrete crack sealant.
- Consider resurfacing the entire stoop with an exterior-grade overlay and apply a non-slip, breathable sealer.
- Confirm stoop slopes away from the door and caulk the threshold to limit water intrusion.
- If large sections sound hollow or keep crumbling, have a concrete contractor evaluate for partial or full replacement.
