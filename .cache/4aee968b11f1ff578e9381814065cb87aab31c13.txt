Location:
- Indoor utility closet / storage area with a storage water heater.

Observations:
- Standard vertical storage water heater; side label visible.
- No obvious corrosion or leaks at the tank base in view.
- Drain/T&P discharge piping not clearly visible in the photo.
- A vertical light-colored rod/pipe obstructs the front view of the unit.

Potential Issues:
- No visible issues noted from the image.

Recommendations:
- Verify that the T&P relief valve discharge piping is present, properly sloped, and terminates to a safe location (material rated for hot water).
- Ensure access is not obstructed by the front rod/pipe; maintain clear working space around the heater.
- Confirm adequate clearance and ventilation for the closet; consider installing a drain pan if none is present.
