Location:
- Interior side of main entry door (tile floor area)

Observations:
- Painted solid-core door with wood casing and tile/metal threshold
- Round knob latchset; surface-mount electronic lock on door stile
- Small round hole at eye level in door slab
- Door sweep present; daylight/shadow visible at bottom edge
- Finish scuffs and wear at lower door and frame
- Minor separations in caulk/paint at casing and baseboard joints
- Welcome mat on tile

Potential Issues:
- Unsealed hole in door slab (likely missing peephole) – pest/air entry; security concern
- Gap at bottom between door and threshold – drafts/pest entry; possible water intrusion if exterior
- Minor gaps/separations in trim caulk at baseboard/jamb
- Cosmetic surface wear on door/trim

Recommendations:
- Install/replace peephole or properly fill/seal hole; repaint to match
- Adjust/replace door sweep and add/renew weatherstripping; verify threshold alignment
- Re-caulk trim/baseboard joints; touch up paint
- Clean and repaint door/trim for protection
- Check operation and security of knob and electronic lock; service as needed
