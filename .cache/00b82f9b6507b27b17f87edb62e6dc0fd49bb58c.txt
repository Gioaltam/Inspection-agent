Location:
- Exterior ground-floor window with metal frame and stone/ concrete sill; screen installed.

Observations:
- Fine-mesh screen intact. - Aluminum window frame shows exterior dirt/dust; faint staining on sill. - Small white spacer/clip visible at bottom of frame. - Light gap/separation between bottom edge of frame and sill; some dirt/debris in the track area. - Minor surface corrosion/dark marks on hardware along the bottom track.

Potential Issues:
- Gap/separation at bottom exterior joint could allow water intrusion. - Debris buildup in the sill/track may impede drainage and operation. - Possible corrosion on bottom-frame hardware. - Potential pest entry point at the bottom seam if gap is unsealed.

Recommendations:
- Clean track and bottom joint; reseal exterior joint with appropriate exterior caulk/sealant. - Inspect and, if needed, repair or replace corroded hardware; ensure proper operation of the sash. - Monitor interior for any signs of moisture or staining after rain and address promptly.
