Location:
- Exterior side/rear entry door in blue-siding wall

Observations:
- Painted 6â€‘panel exterior door; wood casing/trim; concrete stoop
- Heavy dirt/green organic growth on lower door panels
- Wood trim/jambs with peeling paint, dark staining; lower ends deteriorated/missing sections
- Gaps between trim and siding; caulk largely absent/failed
- Door bottom sweep present; appears worn/loose
- Threshold/sill joint to concrete shows cracked/failed sealant
- Scratches/gouges on door surface

Potential Issues:
- Wood rot/decay at exterior trim/jambs; substrate exposed; pieces missing
- Gaps/voids and failed/missing sealant around frame and sill; potential water intrusion and pest entry
- Mold/mildew/algae on door surface indicating persistent moisture
- Damaged/worn door sweep/weatherstripping; possible air/water and pest infiltration
- Cracks/splits in wood trim
- No visible corrosion on hardware

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted exterior casing/jambs; probe and repair/replace any decayed sill/framing (consider PVC/treated materials); repaint
- Consider full prehung door replacement if jamb/sill rot is extensive
- Clean and treat organic growth; wash and repaint door with exterior-grade paint
- Replace door bottom sweep and weatherstripping; adjust for tight seal
- Re-caulk all perimeter joints and threshold-to-concrete seam; add proper flashing/drip cap if missing
- Evaluate and correct moisture sources (splashback, grade, downspouts/overhang)
- Seal remaining gaps to deter pests
