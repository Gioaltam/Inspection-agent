Location:
- Interior ground-level window looking to side yard/exterior stucco wall

Observations:
- Metal-framed horizontal slider window; single-pane glass
- Interior sill painted; perimeter caulk visible
- Exterior stucco wall with rectangular foundation/crawlspace vents near grade
- Shrub planted tight to wall/vent area

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids/separations: small openings and rough/aged caulk at window frame-to-trim (notably bottom-right)
- Missing/loose parts: no insect screen visible on the window
- Cracks: hairline vertical crack visible in exterior stucco between windows
- Water intrusion risk: vents close to grade and shrub against wall can trap moisture and promote splashback
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: vegetation partially obstructing vent area
- Pest entry points: perimeter gaps at window; possible unscreened vents could admit pests
- No visible dents, bends, warping, broken glass, corrosion/rust, mold/mildew/rot, improper wiring, or trip hazards

Recommendations:
- Re-caulk/seal window perimeter; ensure continuous weather seal; touch up paint
- Install/repair insect screen if missing; verify latch/operation and clean tracks
- Trim/relocate shrub; maintain clear airflow to vents and at least several inches clearance from wall
- Ensure grade slopes away from wall; minimize sprinkler overspray near foundation
- Seal and paint the stucco hairline crack; monitor for movement and have evaluated if it widens
- Confirm all foundation vents are properly screened to deter pests
