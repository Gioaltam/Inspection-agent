Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (kitchen/bath)

Observations:
- PVC drain with slip-joint P-trap; ABS (black) trap arm to wall
- Heavy white mineral/scale deposits and staining on fittings
- Pipe penetration into wall/cabinet lacks escutcheon/seal; visible gap
- Storage items and a loose tube/cord around piping

Potential Issues:
- Evidence of past/active leaks at slip-joint fittings (mineral buildup/stains)
- Gap/void at wall penetration; potential pest entry and moisture/odor path
- Possible deteriorated/loose slip-joint washers increasing leak risk
- Crowded storage may contact/stress piping (blocked/unsafe condition)

Recommendations:
- Run water test; tighten/replace slip-joint nuts and washers; replace trap components if needed
- Clean mineral deposits to monitor for fresh leaks
- Install escutcheon and sealant/foam at wall penetration to close gap
- Keep area clear; avoid storing items against plumbing
- If leaks persist or fittings are brittle, have a licensed plumber evaluate/repair
