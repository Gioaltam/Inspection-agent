Location:
- Under-sink base cabinet

Observations:
- Tubular plastic (PVC) P-trap/drain assembly with slip-joint fittings
- Black ABS drain stub-out at back wall/cabinet
- Visible white mineral deposits/staining on trap and nuts
- Open gap around pipe penetration (no escutcheon/seal)
- Storage items placed beneath plumbing

Potential Issues:
- Evidence of past or active leaks at slip-joint fittings (mineral deposits/stains)
- Trap arm-to-wall stub-out connection lacks a visible trap adapter/compression nut; connection appears nonstandard/misaligned—leak risk
- Unsealed wall/cabinet penetration around drain stub-out—pest entry point and moisture/odor pathway
- Storage obstructs access and can conceal leaks

Recommendations:
- Test under flow; rebuild/tighten slip joints with new washers or replace trap components as needed
- Install proper trap adapter/compression connection to ABS stub-out; align and support trap arm
- Seal penetration and add an escutcheon to close gaps and deter pests
- Clear area for inspection; consider a leak tray or water alarm
- If issues persist or configuration is unclear, have a licensed plumber evaluate and correct the drain assembly and venting as needed
