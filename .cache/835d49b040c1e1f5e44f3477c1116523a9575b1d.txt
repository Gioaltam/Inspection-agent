Location:
- Under-sink cabinet at lavatory

Observations:
- Metal drain tailpiece/pop-up assembly; plastic J‑bend trap
- Flexible supply lines; two shutoff valve stubs present
- Escutcheon plates absent at wall penetrations
- Cabinet liner/wallpaper with discoloration/stains

Potential Issues:
- Trap configured as an S‑trap (vertical drop after the U; no horizontal trap arm) — siphoning/sewer‑gas risk; non‑compliant
- Corrosion/mineral buildup at shutoff/supply penetrations
- Gaps/voids around drain and supply penetrations (missing escutcheons/sealant) — pest/odor entry points
- Water stains and residue on trap/underside of sink/cabinet — evidence of past or active leaks

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber reconfigure to a proper vented P‑trap and replace aged trap components/washers
- Evaluate and replace corroded shutoff valves/supply lines as needed; add proper escutcheon plates
- Seal wall penetrations (escutcheons + caulk/foam) to close gaps
- Clean/dry cabinet; replace stained/damaged liner/base and monitor for leaks
- Test drain/pop‑up; reseal drain flange if any seepage is found
