Location:
- Cabinet under sink

Observations:
- Chrome drain tailpiece and pop-up assembly; plastic P-trap
- Two supply lines entering wall with metal escutcheons/valve handles
- Interior cabinet surfaces papered; visible discoloration/stains
- Pop-up linkage rod present

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust on supply valve handles/escutcheons
- Staining/mineral buildup on trap and cabinet surfaces—evidence of prior leakage
- Gaps/voids around wall penetrations (supply lines; possibly drain) – unsealed
- Dark staining on interior surfaces—possible mildew/microbial growth
- Aged/corroded shut-off valves may be difficult to operate or leak
- Potential pest entry through unsealed penetrations

Recommendations:
- Run water and inspect all slip joints/valves for active leaks; tighten or replace gaskets/P-trap if leaking
- Replace/repair corroded shut-off valves; verify smooth operation
- Clean and disinfect cabinet; remove/replace any damaged or soft materials; dry thoroughly
- Seal wall penetrations with proper escutcheons and caulk/foam to block pests and moisture
- If microbial growth suspected, clean with appropriate cleaner and seal/prime surfaces
- Consider replacing aged drain assembly components and re-sealing connections per manufacturer
