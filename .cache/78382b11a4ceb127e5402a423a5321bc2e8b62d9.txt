Location:
- Exterior entry door, porch side; threshold and strike-side jamb (bottom section)

Observations:
- Wood jamb/trim with peeling paint and exposed bare wood
- Aluminum threshold and vertical metal trim; weatherstripping present but deteriorated
- Concrete stoop meets metal threshold; debris in channel

Potential Issues:
- Severe wood rot/decay on jamb and casing; chunks missing and substrate exposed
- Large gaps/voids and separations at jamb-to-threshold and jamb-to-wall interfaces
- Failed/missing caulk and deteriorated weatherstripping
- Cracked/peeling paint and surface delamination
- Possible water intrusion history; moisture staining/darkened wood
- Bent/deformed metal trim/weatherstrip channel; possible misalignment
- Loose/damaged threshold components creating snag/trip hazard
- Openings provide pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/trim and any damaged sub-sill framing; use rot-resistant materials
- Replace/repair threshold and bent metal trim; ensure solid fastening
- Install proper flashing/sill pan, new weatherstripping, and continuous exterior-grade sealant at all joints
- Prep/prime/paint exposed wood after repairs
- Inspect adjacent interior flooring/wall for hidden moisture damage and remediate as needed
- Clean debris from threshold channel and monitor for future leaks
