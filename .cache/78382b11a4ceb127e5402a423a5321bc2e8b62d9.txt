Location:
- Exterior entry door frame/threshold at patio/driveway

Observations:
- Wood door jamb/trim with heavy paint failure and exposed bare wood
- Aluminum threshold/sill with rubber sweep; concrete stoop outside
- Weatherstripping/gasket torn and displaced
- Sections of jamb missing/deteriorated at lower 24 in.; visible cavities/voids
- Gaps at jamb-to-threshold and jamb-to-stop; uneven surfaces; debris present

Potential Issues:
- Significant wood rot/decay in jamb and lower trim
- Cracks, peeling, and substrate exposure susceptible to further moisture damage
- Failed/missing exterior caulk/sealant at multiple joints
- Large gaps/voids creating water intrusion paths and air leakage
- Damaged/missing weatherstripping; poor door seal
- Possible mold/mildew and staining from chronic moisture
- Potential pest entry points through openings and soft wood
- Splintered/loose wood at threshold edge may pose minor snag/cut hazard

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/trim and any damaged sill components; evaluate framing for hidden decay
- Install new weatherstripping and door sweep; ensure proper compression seal
- Re-caulk all exterior joints with exterior-grade sealant; add flashing/drip cap if absent
- Prime and paint all repaired/exposed wood with exterior coatings
- Clear debris; maintain threshold drainage; ensure stoop slopes away from door
- Monitor for ongoing moisture; consider covering/awning to reduce wetting
- If pest activity suspected, consult pest-control professional
