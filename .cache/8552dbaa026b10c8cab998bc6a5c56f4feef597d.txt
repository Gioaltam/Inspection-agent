Location: Hallway – wall vent above doorway

What I See:
- Wall register with visible dust buildup.
- Several louvers appear bent/misaligned.

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged louvers on the register.

Recommended Action:
- Remove and clean the register and surrounding opening to improve airflow.
- Replace the register if louvers are damaged or won’t operate smoothly; use the same size and secure it flush to the wall.
