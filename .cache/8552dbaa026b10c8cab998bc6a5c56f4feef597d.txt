Location: Hallway above interior doorway (HVAC wall register)

What I See:
- Metal register/grille with several bent/deformed louvers.
- Grille isnâ€™t sitting fully flush; small gap/misalignment at the wall.

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged louvers.
- Grille appears loose/not securely fastened.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the register/grille with a new unit of the same size.
- Secure with proper screws/anchors so it sits flush; caulk/paint the perimeter for a clean seal.
- If this is a return, use a non-damper grille; if a supply, ensure the new damper operates smoothly.
- Vacuum the duct opening while the grille is off to remove debris.
