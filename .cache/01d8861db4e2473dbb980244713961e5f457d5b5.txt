Location:
- Exterior wall, ground-level window and sill

Observations:
- Painted wood double-hung sash window set in stucco
- Heavy/uneven paint and caulk at jambs and sill
- Weathered wood sill; multiple paint layers; paint spatter on glass
- Stucco-to-trim transitions visible; no screen present

Potential Issues:
- Cracks and separations at stucco-to-trim joints, especially lower corners
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk in areas; excessive patching suggests prior leaks
- Deteriorated/peeling paint on sill; potential moisture damage/incipient rot
- Aged glazing/paint at glass edges; possible failed glazing compound
- Possible misalignment/painted-shut sashes; operability concern
- Small gaps could serve as pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Scrape, prep, and repaint exterior wood with quality exterior coating
- Remove failed caulk; properly re-caulk perimeter joints; tool smooth and seal to stucco
- Evaluate sill and lower corners for soft/rotted wood; repair/replace as needed
- Re-glaze any loose/cracked glazing; clean paint from glass
- Test window operation; free painted edges and service balances as needed
- Monitor for water intrusion after rains; address if staining noted inside
