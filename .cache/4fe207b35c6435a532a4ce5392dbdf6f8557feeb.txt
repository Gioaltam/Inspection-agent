- Front entrance ramp: Wood ramp with metal handrails to the door. Weathered boards; some warping. Check railing securement and replace damaged boards to reduce trip risk.
- Exterior materials: Vinyl siding (cream) over a 1-story wood frame; asphalt shingle roof. Dark staining/mildew at grade level on right side siding; inspect for moisture intrusion.
- Ground/grading: Grass against foundation; no visible downspout extensions. Ensure grading slopes away from the house and clear vegetation to improve drainage.
- Concrete path/landing: Concrete approach shows cracks and a rough patch near ramp; potential trip hazard; repair or replace as needed.
- Overall condition: No obvious structural failure from this view, but moisture/moisture-related concerns at siding and ramp stability should be addressed.
