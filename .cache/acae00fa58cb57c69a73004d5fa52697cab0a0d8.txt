Location:
- Ceiling vent (likely bathroom exhaust) in interior ceiling.

Observations:
- Popcorn/textured ceiling finish.
- White square vent cover with horizontal slats.
- Dirt/dust on vent; brownish staining around the vent edge on the ceiling.

Potential Issues:
- Moisture staining around vent could indicate moisture intrusion or condensation.
- Possible mold/mildew behind or around vent if moisture is ongoing.
- Potential improper sealing around vent allowing air/moisture leakage.

Recommendations:
- Clean vent and surrounding area; note if stains reappear.
- Inspect source of moisture (roof leak, plumbing, or attic condensation); check duct to exterior for proper venting and seal gaps.
- Re-seal around vent with appropriate caulk/trim; ensure duct is securely connected and unobstructed.
- If staining persists or mold is suspected, have a mold assessment/remediation done; consider replacing vent cover if corroded or damaged.
