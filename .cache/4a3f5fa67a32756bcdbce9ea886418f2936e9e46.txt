Location:
- Ceiling-mounted HVAC return/supply grille

Observations:
- White metal louvered grille
- Heavy dust accumulation on louvers and center divider
- Visible dust/debris inside duct just behind grille
- Paint/finish intact; no visible dents or rust

Potential Issues:
- Airflow restricted by significant dust buildup (blocked condition; indoor air quality concern)
- No visible cracks, gaps, loose parts, corrosion, water stains, or mold

Recommendations:
- Remove grille and clean thoroughly; vacuum/brush louvers and surrounding duct opening
- Replace/clean HVAC filter and ensure proper fit/seal
- Consider HVAC/duct cleaning and system service if buildup is recurring or if maintenance history is unknown
