Location:
- Ceiling return-air grille/vent

Observations:
- Metal louvered grille; ceiling-mounted
- Heavy lint/dust accumulation on louvers and center divider
- Light dirt streaking around grille perimeter
- No filter visible at grille (filter may be at air handler)
- Louvers appear straight; surrounding drywall/paint intact

Potential Issues:
- Airflow restriction from heavy dust buildup
- Indoor air quality concern from accumulated debris
- Air leakage indicated by dark dust lines at grille perimeter (possible gap/bypass at grille-to-duct connection)
- Filter may be overdue or poorly sealing upstream

Recommendations:
- Remove grille; clean louvers and accessible return plenum
- Replace/verify HVAC filter location; install correct size and ensure tight seal
- Inspect and seal any gaps at grille frame and return-duct connection with mastic/foil tape
- Consider duct inspection/cleaning if dust quickly reaccumulates
- Touch up paint after cleaning if desired
