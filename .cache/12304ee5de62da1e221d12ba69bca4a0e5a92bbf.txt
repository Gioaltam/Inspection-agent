Location:
- Exterior window, first-floor, double-hung style with bottom sash screen.

Observations:
- Interior blinds shown; security sticker on upper sash.
- Screen installed on bottom sash; white painted trim around window.
- Sealant/caulk line visible around bottom perimeter; some minor paint wear on sill.
- Glass appears intact; no visible condensation or cracks.

Potential Issues:
- Gap/void in sealant along bottom exterior perimeter (potential water intrusion path).
- Paint wear/possible minor substrate exposure on the sill area (possible wood deterioration with moisture).

Recommendations:
- Re-caulk exterior perimeter around the window to reseal and prevent water intrusion.
- Inspect sill and surrounding trim for any rot or moisture damage; repair/replace and repaint as needed.
- Monitor interior for any signs of moisture or staining after rain; address promptly if detected.
