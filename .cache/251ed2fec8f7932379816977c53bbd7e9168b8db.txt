Location:
- Front exterior elevation, driveway/parking, front porch/screened area

Observations:
- Single-story home; painted CMU/block walls
- Low-slope asphalt-shingle roof; shallow eaves with painted fascia/trim
- Screened porch/carport extension with slender wood posts
- Window with decorative shutters; exterior floodlight
- Landscape beds with block edging along foundation
- Unpaved gravel/dirt driveway; old wood landscape timbers at edges
- No gutters/downspouts visible

Potential Issues:
- Broken/rotted landscape timbers loose at driveway edge—trip/fall hazard
- Driveway surface uneven with bare soil—trip hazard and poor vehicle footing
- Roof shingles appear aged with discoloration and minor waviness—reduced remaining life/leak risk
- Slight sag/uneven eave line at front—possible edge/framing deterioration
- No gutters—roof runoff may cause erosion and splash against walls; foundation moisture risk
- Vegetation and raised beds tight to wall—moisture retention and pest pathways
- Porch wood posts appear in contact with slab/soil—rot/termite risk at bases

Recommendations:
- Remove and replace deteriorated landscape timbers; level/secure driveway surface
- Roofing contractor to evaluate shingles and eave condition; repair or replace as needed
- Consider installing gutters/downspouts with extensions to discharge away from foundation
- Maintain clearance between soil/mulch and walls; trim plantings; monitor for pests
- Provide proper post bases/anchors with moisture separation; repair/flash as needed
- Inspect and maintain exterior paint and sealant at trim/windows to keep water out
