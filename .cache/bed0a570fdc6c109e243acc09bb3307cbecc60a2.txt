Location:
- Exterior freestanding storage shed in yard

Observations:
- Painted panel siding; double swing doors with surface strap repairs and padlock hasp
- Doors visibly deformed; daylight gap at meeting stile/bottom
- Low-slope roof with simple edge trim; no gutters; roof details partly obscured by sun
- Heavy surface staining/oxidation on siding and doors; paint weathered
- Tall vegetation and soil contacting lower walls/door edges

Potential Issues:
- Dents/bends/warping on both doors; lower panels creased
- Crack/split at door meeting edge; substrate exposure likely
- Gaps/voids at bottom and center of doors; misalignment; compromised security
- Possible loose/missing fasteners at straps/trim
- Failed/missing sealant at joints/roof-to-wall transitions
- Corrosion/oxidation and paint failure on metal surfaces
- Water staining/soiling on doors; potential moisture intrusion
- Vegetation/soil contact against siding; moisture retention and decay risk
- Pest entry points via door gaps and penetrations
- Sharp bent metal edges at door bottom (laceration hazard)
- Trip hazard from overgrown grass at entrance

Recommendations:
- Replace/rebuild and realign doors; install proper latch, threshold/sweep, and weatherstripping to eliminate gaps
- Remove vegetation and maintain 12â€“18 in clearance; keep siding off soil; add gravel border for drainage
- Clean/scrape; treat rust; prime and repaint exterior; replace any corroded/rotted panels or trim
- Reseal joints and roof-to-wall interfaces with appropriate exterior sealant/flashings
- Inspect roof covering for damage/leaks and repair or replace as needed; consider drip edge/gutter
- Verify shed sits on sound, level skids/foundation and is properly anchored
- Seal all openings to deter pests; remove/trim sharp edges on damaged metal panels
