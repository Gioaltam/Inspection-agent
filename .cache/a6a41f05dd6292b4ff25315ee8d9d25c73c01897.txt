- Location: Interior wall/ceiling corner; below popcorn-textured ceiling.  
- Ceiling: Popcorn texture over drywall; no active leakage visible in photo.  
- Wall: Drywall with patching compound (repair area) near corner.  
- Surface condition: Peeling/flaking paint at patch; irregular, rough patches with brown staining.  
- Likely moisture indicator: Stains and patch failure suggest prior moisture intrusion; need source check (roof/plumbing) and drying.  
- Recommended actions: Inspect for leaks, repair damaged drywall, reseal/paint, and address moisture source.
