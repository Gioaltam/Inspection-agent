Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit (Ruud) against exterior wall of residence; near window and wall-mounted electrical components; vegetation at base.

Observations:
- Gray Ruud condenser with vertical louvers; top edge shows surface wear.
- Ground grasses growing directly against and around the base.
- Cracks and stain lines in the stucco wall behind the unit.
- External electrical conduit and weatherproof box mounted on wall.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with unit (airflow restriction, moisture retention, pest ingress risk).
- Cracks in stucco could allow moisture intrusion if not sealed.
- Unclear clearance around unit (airflow could be impeded if plants remain).
- Electrical components in proximity to vegetation; verify weatherproofing and clearance.

Recommendations:
- Trim back vegetation to maintain at least 12â€“24 inches clearance around unit.
- Seal stucco cracks and monitor for new cracking or moisture intrusion; repair as needed.
- Confirm unit is on a level, appropriate pad; install/verify pad as required.
- Have HVAC/electrical tech inspect wiring/conduit for proper weatherproofing and secure mounting.
