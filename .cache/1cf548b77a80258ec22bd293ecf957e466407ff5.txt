Location:
- Inside HVAC equipment area (likely furnace/air handler plenum). Front circular opening in plenum.

Observations:
- Circular cutout/opening at front of plenum with a blue nitrile glove stuffed inside.
- Dirt/dust build-up on bottom surface of the plenum.
- Black blower housing and flexible conduit/wiring nearby.

Potential Issues:
- Obstruction of return/supply opening by glove (restricted airflow, potential overheating, efficiency loss).
- Improvised sealing (glove) that may deteriorate and release debris or harbor mold/pests.
- No proper duct cap or sealing around the opening; potential air leakage.
- Visible dirt accumulation; potential moisture/mold risk if moisture present.
- Edge of cutout appears rough; possible improper fabrication/sealing needs.

Recommendations:
- Remove the glove and install a proper cap/duct closure or replace with correct boot and seal with approved duct sealant or foil tape.
- Have HVAC technician inspect for airflow balance, clean interior surfaces, and replace/clean filters as needed.
- Inspect for moisture or mold; treat or remediate if found; reseal plenum joints properly.
- Verify electrical wiring is properly protected and routed away from heat/moisture; secure as per code.
- If components show rust/damage, replace or repair as needed; ensure adequate clearances around the unit.
