Location:
- Exterior side yard wall under eave/soffit

Observations:
- Horizontal lap siding with vented soffit/fascia; no gutter visible at eave
- Window at left
- Large accumulation: stacked tires/wheels, bicycles, small boat/kayak, plywood leaning on wall
- Vegetation/weeds against structure

Potential Issues:
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: debris piled against wall; obstructs access to siding/window; falling-object risk
- Trip/fall hazards from scattered wheels/debris
- Conducive to pests: tires/wood and vegetation at foundation; potential rodent/insect harborage; termite risk from wood-to-soil contact
- Tires can collect standing water; mosquito-breeding hazard
- Items tight to siding can trap moisture; light surface staining/algae visible on siding; risk of water damage/mold
- Increased fire load from stored tires/wood near structure
- No visible dents, cracks, gaps, loose/missing parts, substrate exposure, or corrosion on siding/soffit in this view

Recommendations:
- Remove/relocate debris; maintain 12â€“24 in clearance from siding; keep window egress area clear
- Properly dispose of or store tires covered and off ground; drain any standing water; monitor for pests
- Trim vegetation; remove plywood/wood from soil contact
- Clean siding; treat algae/mildew; after clearing, inspect and seal/caulk as needed
- Consider adding gutters/downspouts to manage roof runoff if none present
- Reinspect wall/soffit after area is cleared to check for hidden damage or moisture issues
