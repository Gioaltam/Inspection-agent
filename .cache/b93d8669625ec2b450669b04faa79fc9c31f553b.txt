Location:
- Interior residential room ceiling, ceiling fan with light kit.

Observations:
- White ceiling fan with four blades and glass light globe; pull chains hang from the unit.
- Left blade appears bent/dished near the tip; blade mounting area shows usual hardware.
- No obvious water stains or mold on ceiling; no visible corrosion or exposed wiring.

Potential Issues:
- Warped/bent blade (left blade) could cause imbalance, vibration, or potential blade/fan failure.
- Potential loose blade-to-hub screws not visible; risk of further loosening or detachment if not inspected.

Recommendations:
- Power off and inspect all blade-to-hub mounting screws; replace or straighten the damaged blade.
- Balance the fan after any blade replacement or adjustment; verify no excessive wobble.
- If wobble persists or other blades show damage, consider replacing the blade set or the entire fan.
