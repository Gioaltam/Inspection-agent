Location:
- Exterior wall, ground-level window in light-blue lap siding

Observations:
- Aluminum single-hung window with screen; metal head flashing
- Aged perimeter caulk; small gaps at corners
- Debris/dirt in window sill/track
- Lower siding course with heavy paint flaking; substrate visible
- Dirt splash staining at base of wall
- Vegetation touching/right of window
- Interior blinds bent/broken (cosmetic)

Potential Issues:
- Peeling/failed paint with substrate exposure on lower siding; moisture intrusion/rot risk
- Cracked/missing caulk at window-to-siding joints; gaps/voids present
- Bent/misaligned head flashing end at top-right; possible pathway for water
- Debris in sill/track may block weep drainage; water retention risk
- Vegetation contact can trap moisture and create pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Scrape/prep, prime, and repaint affected siding; repair/replace any damaged/soft areas
- Remove and reapply exterior-grade sealant around full window perimeter
- Evaluate and repair/replace head flashing; ensure proper fit and shedding
- Clean window tracks; verify weep holes are clear
- Trim vegetation back 12+ inches from wall and maintain clearance
- Monitor interior below window for any water staining or leaks
