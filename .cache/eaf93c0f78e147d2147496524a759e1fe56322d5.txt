Location:
- Exterior, ground-level window in lap-siding wall (blue painted)

Observations:
- Aluminum-framed single-hung window with insect screen
- Painted wood/fiber-cement lap siding and trim around window
- Perimeter caulk at frame-to-trim appears aged/cracked in areas
- Sill/track shows dirt/debris; weep path not clearly visible
- Bottom skirt/trim board along foundation has heavy paint failure and bare wood
- Soil splash staining on lower siding; vegetation close to wall
- Interior blinds damaged (cosmetic)

Potential Issues:
- Failed/missing sealant at window perimeter; visible gaps/separations that can allow water/pest entry
- Substrate exposure at lower trim/skirt board with peeling paint; possible moisture damage/rot developing
- Dirt/debris in window track may block drainage/weep holes, raising leak risk
- Vegetation against siding can trap moisture and provide pest pathways
- Soil splashback on siding indicates high moisture exposure near grade

Recommendations:
- Remove loose paint on lower trim; repair/replace any rotted wood; prime and repaint
- Re-caulk/seal all window perimeter joints; ensure continuous, flexible exterior-grade sealant
- Clean window tracks; verify/clear weep holes for proper drainage
- Re-seat/repair window screen for insect exclusion
- Trim vegetation back 12–18 in. from siding; maintain 6–8 in. siding-to-soil clearance; improve grading/drainage or add splash control to reduce splashback
- Monitor interior around window after rain for signs of leaks; repair if found
