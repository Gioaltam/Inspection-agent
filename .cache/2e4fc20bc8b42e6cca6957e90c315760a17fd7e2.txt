Location:
- Bathroom tub/shower alcove

Observations:
- Porcelain/enamel bathtub with ceramic tile surround
- Metal tub spout, overflow cover, and drain flange
- Surface shows heavy wear/etching and discoloration
- Visible corrosion/tarnish on spout and drain/overflow trim
- No visible drain stopper installed
- Shower curtain present

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust on tub spout and drain/overflow trim
- Worn/etched tub finish; porous areas can harbor mildew and are harder to clean
- Slip hazard likely; no evident anti-slip surface
- Missing drain stopper; can allow debris entry and reduce seal during fills

Recommendations:
- Replace corroded tub spout and refresh/replace drain and overflow trim
- Deep clean and consider professional tub refinishing/reglazing
- Install non-slip mat or adhesive strips
- Install/repair drain stopper assembly
- Inspect tub-to-tile joint; re-caulk any gaps to prevent water intrusion
- Check for leaks at spout and waste/overflow connections after repairs
