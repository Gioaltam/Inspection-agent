Location: Wall HVAC vent/register

What I See:
- Center louvers are bent/deformed; left side shows a broken/loose tab.
- Light dust buildup; faint stain running down the wall below the vent.

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged louvers and broken adjustment tab.
- Possible air leak/condensation at the register causing wall staining.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the register grille to restore airflow and appearance.
- Remove the grille and inspect the duct-to-boot connection; seal gaps with mastic or UL-181 foil tape and insulate the boot if itâ€™s in an exterior wall/attic.
- Clean the opening, then clean/prime/paint the stained wall area after confirming moisture is resolved.
