Location: Wall HVAC vent/register

What I See: Several vent louvers are bent/broken; visible dust buildup inside the register.

Issues to Address:
- Damaged/bent louvers on the register.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the register grille to restore proper airflow and appearance.
- Clean the duct opening while the grille is off; check/replace HVAC filters.
- If the wall stain under the vent is fresh or recurring, check for condensation at this supply register and verify duct/boot insulation.
