Location:
- Under kitchen sink, cabinet base.

Observations:
- White PVC drain assembly with slip-joint nuts (tailpiece → tee → P-trap → trap arm to wall).
- Brownish mineral staining at the lower tailpiece/tee joints.
- One side branch of the tee appears capped or unused.
- Cabinet clutter/ pots nearby; no visible active water stains on cabinet floor in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Possible past leak indicated by brown staining at slip-joint areas.
- Minor misalignment or looseness risk at joints (tighten/inspect washers).
- Unused side branch on the tee (cap condition unknown; potential odor/leak risk if not properly sealed).
- No evidence of active mold, rot, or corrosion visible, but stains warrant a water-test.

Recommendations:
- Tighten slip-nut joints and inspect/replace washers as needed; clean and reseal with proper compression washers.
- Run water and inspect for leaks at all joints; address any active seepage.
- Confirm the side branch is properly capped or connected (if unused, ensure cap is tight and in good condition).
- If stains recur or moisture is seen, consider replacing damaged section or applying PVC-safe sealant as appropriate.
