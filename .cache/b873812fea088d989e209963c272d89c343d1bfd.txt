Location:
- Exterior side door/jamb at blue lap-siding wall, ground level

Observations:
- Painted wood door; green staining/algae at lower panel
- Wood brickmold/jamb on latch side severely deteriorated; missing sections
- Exposed inner wood at jamb; dark staining at base near threshold
- Open joints where trim meets door and siding; paint/caulk weathered
- Vegetation and stored materials/bags against wall at base

Potential Issues:
- Significant rot/decay in door jamb/brickmold; substrate exposure and loss of integrity
- Large gaps/voids and separations at jamb and base; likely water intrusion path
- Failed/missing sealant/paint at trim-to-door and trim-to-siding joints
- Mold/mildew growth and moisture staining on door surface
- Possible pest entry points through rotted openings at lower corner
- Debris/vegetation against wall creates moisture retention and trip hazard

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/brickmold and evaluate/repair threshold and underlying framing as needed
- Install proper flashing/drip details; back-prime and paint new exterior wood
- Re-caulk all trim-to-siding/door joints and repaint exposed areas
- Clean algae/mildew; correct moisture sources and improve drainage/splash protection
- Remove vegetation and stored materials from wall; maintain clearance
- Consider pest inspection/treatment due to conducive conditions and openings
