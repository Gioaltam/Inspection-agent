Location:
- Exterior side entry door and adjacent siding, near ground level

Observations:
- Painted wood door and wood jamb/trim; lap siding (blue)
- Lower jamb/trim severely deteriorated with missing wood; darkened base at slab
- Open seams between trim and siding; cracked/peeling paint; missing/failed caulk
- Heavy green algae/mildew staining on lower door surface
- Vegetation growing at base; bags/debris stored against wall

Potential Issues:
- Significant wood rot/decay and loss of material in door jamb/trim; structural integrity compromised
- Gaps/voids and substrate exposure at trim and base; likely pest entry points
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk at trim-to-siding joints
- Evidence of chronic moisture: water staining and algae/mildew growth; high risk of water intrusion at jamb/threshold
- Possible loose/missing fasteners at deteriorated trim sections
- Blocked/unsafe conditions and trip hazard from vegetation and stored materials near egress

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/trim; evaluate underlying framing/threshold for hidden decay and repair as needed
- Install proper flashing/sill pan and weatherproofing; recaulk all trim-to-siding joints and repaint
- Clean and treat mildew/algae on door; correct moisture sources and improve drainage/splash protection
- Remove vegetation and stored materials from contact with structure; keep area clear for egress
- Monitor for pest activity; seal openings after repairs
