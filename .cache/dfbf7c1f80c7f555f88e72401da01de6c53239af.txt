Location:
- Exterior side wall, ground level below two windows.

Observations:
- Horizontal vinyl lap siding; two dark-framed windows.
- Numerous loose tires/rims, tarp, broken chair frame, and plywood stacked against wall.
- Tall weeds/vegetation at foundation.
- Light dirt/algae staining on siding.

Potential Issues:
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: Debris and tires obstruct window area and access; potential egress blockage.
- Trip/fall hazards from loose tires and cluttered ground.
- Pest/vector harborage: Tires can hold standing water; debris invites rodents/insects.
- Vegetation contacting siding—holds moisture and provides pest pathways.
- Mildew/algae staining on siding indicates elevated moisture.
- Fire load hazard from tire storage near structure.
- Possible racked/tilted left window frame (visible lean)—may indicate frame distortion.

Recommendations:
- Remove/dispose or store tires and debris away from structure; keep area clear for egress and maintenance.
- Cut back vegetation; maintain clearance around siding/foundation.
- Clean siding (low-pressure wash with mildewcide) and monitor for recurring moisture.
- After clearing/cleaning, inspect windows/trim for plumb/square and damage; repair or replace as needed; seal/caulk as appropriate.
- Eliminate standing water in/around tires; implement pest control as needed.
