Location:
- Exterior side yard wall beneath two windows

Observations:
- Horizontal vinyl siding with J-channel trim around two windows
- Dark-framed windows with screens; glazing appears intact
- Multiple tires/wheels, plywood, tarp, folding chair piled against wall
- Overgrown grass/vegetation at base of wall
- Light dirt/algae staining on siding

Potential Issues:
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: debris/tires stacked against wall and windows
- Trip/fall hazard from scattered tires and uneven ground
- Vegetation contacting siding; conducive to moisture and pests
- Tires/tarp can trap water at siding; potential moisture intrusion risk
- Tires can hold standing water; pest harborage (mosquitoes/rodents)
- Surface algae/mildew staining on siding
- No visible dents, bends, warping, cracks, gaps, loose/missing fasteners, corrosion, or water stains on siding/windows from this view

Recommendations:
- Remove/relocate debris and tires; keep clear zone along wall (12â€“18 in)
- Eliminate standing water; store/dispose of tires properly; consider pest control if activity noted
- Trim/mow vegetation; keep plants off siding; maintain positive drainage
- Soft-wash siding to remove algae/mildew; monitor for recurrence
- After clearing, inspect window/siding joints and re-caulk/seal any gaps
- Avoid leaning plywood/tarps against the house to prevent moisture retention
