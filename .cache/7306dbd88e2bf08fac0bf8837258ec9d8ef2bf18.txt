Location:
- Under kitchen sink in cabinet.

Observations:
- Metal sink tailpiece connects to white plastic P-trap with slip-nuts.
- Blue-handled shut-off valve on a supply line visible.
- Cabinet floor/back shows brown staining and some moisture/age marks.
- Misc. items and cleaners stored in cabinet.

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at the metal-to-plastic drain connection (tailpiece area) suggesting potential leak risk.
- Water staining on cabinet bottom/back indicates past moisture intrusion or slow leak.
- Unclear trap alignment; potential for improper seal or slow drip if joints are loose.
- No visible evidence of moisture barrier or rot treatment around stained area.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and replace corroded metal tailpiece or entire drain assembly as needed; reseal slip joints and re-tighten.
- Clean, dry, and repair any water-damaged cabinet wood; consider a moisture barrier or liner.
- Test for leaks by running water and watching joints; replace damaged components to stop any active leaks.
- Verify any dishwasher drain connection (if present); ensure proper high loop or air gap and secure hose.
