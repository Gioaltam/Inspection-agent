Location:
- Left side yard/exterior wall and adjacent chain-link fence/gate

Observations:
- Stucco exterior wall with small window; low concrete/masonry steps at near left
- Ground/grass runs flush against stucco base; no visible foundation exposure
- White exterior cable/line tacked to stucco; small white discharge/pipe stub near grade
- No gutters/downspouts visible along eave
- Tall vegetation cluster at fence; large tree limbs overhanging yard/roof area
- Chain-link gate appears out of plumb relative to post

Potential Issues:
- Soil/vegetation in contact with stucco; insufficient clearance—moisture/termite risk
- Flat/low grading along foundation; potential negative drainage and water intrusion at base
- Exposed exterior cable loosely supported; missing conduit/adequate protection—damage/shock risk if not low-voltage
- Overgrown vegetation and overhanging limbs contacting/near structure—pest pathways and abrasion risk
- Chain-link gate leaning/misaligned—security concern and snag/trip potential at threshold
- Splashback staining at lower stucco; absence of gutters may contribute
- No visible cracks, corrosion, or mold from this vantage

Recommendations:
- Lower grade/maintain 4–6 in clearance at stucco; regrade to slope away (min ~6 in fall over 10 ft); add drainage swale as needed
- Install gutters/downspouts with extensions to discharge away from foundation
- Secure/route exterior cable properly (UV-rated conduit or approved fasteners); verify conductor type and compliance
- Trim/remove vegetation at wall and clear limbs back from roof; maintain clear inspection/air gap
- Realign/repair gate and posts; ensure smooth, safe operation
- Monitor stucco base for continued moisture staining; seal/paint as needed after drying
