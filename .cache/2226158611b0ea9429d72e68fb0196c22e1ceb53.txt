Location:
- Interior floor; laminate/engineered wood planks (room not specified)

Observations:
- Oak-look laminate/engineered wood finish
- Long longitudinal seam opened; dark void visible
- End-joint misaligned; corner loss at one plank
- Edge chipping and minor surface scratches; small paint/adhesive specks
- Core/underlayment visible at gap; edges appear slightly swollen

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids/separations along plank seam
- Misalignment and possible lippage; toe-stub/trip hazard
- Edge chipping/delamination; substrate exposure
- Likely failed locking joint; boards may be loose
- Possible moisture-related swelling; increased risk of water intrusion through seam

Recommendations:
- Have a flooring contractor evaluate; re-seat/relock or replace damaged planks
- Inspect for moisture sources and test subfloor moisture; correct leaks/humidity and verify proper expansion gaps
- Clean debris from seam; use color-matched filler only as a temporary cosmetic measure
- Replace affected section if movement or swelling is widespread
