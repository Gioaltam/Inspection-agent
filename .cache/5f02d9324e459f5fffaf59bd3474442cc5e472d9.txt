Location:
- Exterior wooden privacy fence (close-up of picket section)

Observations:
- Vertical wood pickets; weathered/gray with knots
- Galvanized/coated nails at mid-height; rails visible through gaps
- Light green surface staining/algae; general UV wear
- Some pickets show cupping/warping and surface checking

Potential Issues:
- Warping/cupping of multiple boards
- Surface cracks/checking near knots; one board shows longitudinal split
- Gaps between pickets wider than typical privacy spacing
- Rusting nail heads beginning to stain wood
- Algae/mildew staining on surfaces

Recommendations:
- Clean fence (wood-safe cleaner) and treat for algae/mildew
- Apply exterior wood sealer/stain after cleaning and drying
- Replace any split/warped boards that are loose or structurally weakened
- Replace corroded fasteners with exterior-rated galvanized or stainless steel
- Inspect posts/rails for rot, especially at grade, and repair as needed
