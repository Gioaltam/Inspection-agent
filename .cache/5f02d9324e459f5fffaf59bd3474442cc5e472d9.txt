Location:
- Exterior wooden privacy fence section (vertical pickets)

Observations:
- Weathered, untreated/gray wood; likely pressure-treated
- Vertical pickets nailed to horizontal rails; nails visible
- Uneven spacing; some boards cupped/warped
- Surface discoloration with algae/mildew staining
- Knotting and grain checks in several boards

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/checks in multiple pickets; larger split near knot (structural weakening)
- Warping/cupping causing misalignment and widened gaps/voids
- Corroding/rusting nail heads (fastener deterioration risk)
- Organic growth (mildew/algae) present
- Bare wood/failed finish increasing moisture absorption
- Gaps may serve as pest entry points and reduce privacy

Recommendations:
- Clean with low-pressure wash and mildew/algae treatment
- Apply exterior-grade stain/sealant; seal all sides and end grains
- Replace severely split or warped pickets
- Replace corroded nails with coated or stainless fasteners; resecure loose boards
- Inspect base of pickets for rot/softness and repair as needed
- Re-space/adjust pickets if improved privacy is desired
