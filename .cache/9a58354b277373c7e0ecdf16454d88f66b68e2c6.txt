Location:
- Exterior entry door at slab/patio, lower hinge-side jamb and threshold

Observations:
- Door panel appears fiberglass/metal; heavy dirt and green/black biological growth
- Wood brickmold/jamb with peeling paint and dark moisture staining
- Bottom of jamb shows softened, deteriorated wood; open nail holes
- Missing/failed caulk between trim and siding and at threshold joint
- Concrete/stone threshold/stoop with grime and minor surface spalling
- Door bottom weatherstrip/sweep appears worn; visible debris in track

Potential Issues:
- Wood rot/decay at lower jamb/brickmold
- Gaps/voids at trim-to-siding and trim-to-threshold; failed/missing sealant
- Substrate exposure due to peeling paint and rot
- Potential water intrusion at threshold/jamb; staining consistent with moisture
- Mold/mildew growth on door surface and jamb
- Pest entry points via gaps and deteriorated wood
- Loose/deteriorated fasteners (open nail holes in trim)
- Minor cracking/spalling at concrete threshold

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted jamb/brickmold; evaluate underlying framing for moisture damage
- Remove and reflash/reseal door perimeter; properly caulk all joints
- Replace/adjust door bottom sweep and weatherstripping
- Clean and treat biological growth; prep and repaint door and trim with exterior-grade coatings
- Repair patch/epoxy minor concrete spalls; improve drainage and splash control at entry
- Monitor after rain; if leaks persist, consider full door unit replacement and sill pan installation
