Location:
- Exterior door/frame at side/patio entry

Observations:
- Painted wood door jamb/trim abutting lap siding and concrete stoop
- Door surface heavily soiled with green/black biological growth
- Bottom of wood trim in direct contact with concrete
- Multiple old fastener holes and deteriorated/peeling paint on trim
- Visible gap/void at lower jamb-to-sill corner; caulk missing/failed
- Threshold and weatherstrip area dirty; debris in track

Potential Issues:
- Wood rot/decay at lower jamb/brickmold; substrate exposure
- Gaps/voids at jamb-to-sill and jamb-to-siding joints (failed/missing sealant)
- Water intrusion risk at deteriorated joints and rotted wood; staining present
- Mold/mildew/algae on door and threshold surfaces
- Possible pest entry points via holes/voids in trim
- Slippery surface hazard on algae-covered sill/stoop

Recommendations:
- Remove and replace rotted jamb/brickmold; ensure proper clearance from concrete
- Re-seal all perimeters with exterior-grade caulk; repair/replace damaged weatherstripping
- Clean door, threshold, and stoop with mildew/algae cleaner; disinfect and rinse
- Prime and paint replaced/stripped wood with exterior-rated coating
- Inspect underlying framing and sub-sill for moisture damage; repair as needed
- Consider adding/improving flashing/sill pan at door to reduce future water wicking
