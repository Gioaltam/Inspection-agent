Location:
- Under-sink drain assembly in cabinet.

Observations:
- White PVC drain with P-trap and slip-joint connections.
- Trap arm appears to feed directly into a vertical drop (possible S-trap configuration).
- Cabinet floor shows brown staining/dirtâ€”likely past moisture.
- Flexible metal supply line and small valve visible above.
- No visible vent/cleanout in the photographed area.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected S-trap (vertical drop from trap) risk of siphoning and sewer gas intrusion.
- Past leaks indicated by cabinet staining.
- Several slip-joint connections could loosen over time and leak.
- No accessible cleanout shown.

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber confirm venting and reconfigure to a proper trap arm with vent (eliminate S-trap if present).
- Tighten/repair any leaking joints; replace stained components as needed.
- Clean and seal cabinet; inspect for mold/rot if moisture is confirmed.
- Ensure a cleanout is accessible if required by code.
- Verify dishwasher drain/supply connections for proper routing and sealing.
