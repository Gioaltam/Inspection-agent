Location:
- Exterior backyard; along edge of a small wood deck/step and lawn

Observations:
- Overgrown grass and weeds throughout yard
- Chain-link fence in background
- Painted wood deck/step with weathered, peeling paint; bare wood exposed at edges
- Vegetation in direct contact with deck/step

Potential Issues:
- Trip/fall hazard from splintered/deteriorated deck-edge boards
- Failed coating with exposed wood substrate; edge damage/cracking
- Vegetation holding moisture against wood; conducive to rot/termites/pests
- Possible inadequate ground clearance between soil/vegetation and deck wood

Recommendations:
- Cut/clear vegetation; maintain clearance around structures (6â€“12 in.)
- Repair/replace damaged deck boards; remove splinters and secure edges
- Sand and refinish deck with exterior-grade sealant/paint after drying
- Inspect underlying framing and fasteners for rot/looseness; replace as needed
- Consider pest inspection if wood contact with soil has been ongoing
