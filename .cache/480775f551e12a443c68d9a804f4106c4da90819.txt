Location:
- Interior door (door surface shows a long vertical split)

Observations:
- Large vertical crack running full height of door face near the knob area
- Veneer/paint chipped along crack; core material exposed (brown interior)
- Door knob area intact; no obvious frame damage visible in photo

Potential Issues:
- Structural compromise of door (core exposure, potential for further cracking)
- Possible moisture/impact cause behind the crack (unknown without further inspection)
- If exterior door, potential for air/water intrusion; security and insulation concerns

Recommendations:
- Replace door or have door re-skin/repaired by a carpenter
- Inspect surrounding jamb and alignment for binding or movement; repair if misaligned
- Check for moisture behind the door and in adjacent drywall; address any moisture/mold if found
- Repaint and reseal as needed; install proper weatherstripping if exterior door

No other safety hazards identified from the photo.
