Location:
- Interior face of a painted paneled entry/garage-service door

Observations:
- Painted 6â€‘panel door with lever handle/lockset
- Heavy surface dirt/soot on door face and edges
- Multiple sanded/primed repair spots on lower panels/stiles
- Scuffs/abrasion along lower edge and threshold area
- Painted jamb/casing with grime at lower sections

Potential Issues:
- Dents/deformations in lower panels
- Hairline crack/separation at lower vertical stile/panel joint
- Finish failure with bare/primed substrate exposed in several areas
- Heavy soot-like soiling on door surface (possible air leakage if separating garage from living space)
- No visible corrosion/rust, water stains, or mold

Recommendations:
- Clean/degrease door and adjacent trim; determine source of soot/soiling
- Repair dents and crack/seam; sand, prime, and repaint entire door to seal exposed substrate
- Inspect/adjust or replace weatherstripping and door sweep to improve air seal
- Evaluate door operation and hardware; repair/replace if damaged or not latching securely
- If this is a garage-to-house door, have it evaluated for proper self-closing and air-sealing performance
