Location:
- Interior floor: engineered hardwood/plank flooring (oak grain). Damaged area visible on two boards, with a noticeable gouge and a chipped edge.

Observations:
- Large gouge on one plank exposing underlying substrate/core.
- Adjacent plank shows a small chip; slight edge/seam opening near right side.
- Overall finish looks consistent aside from damaged spots; no visible water stains or mold in the photo.

Potential Issues:
- Delamination risk from core/substrate exposure.
- Possible moisture intrusion or prior water damage (suspected due to core exposure, though not confirmed).
- Trip hazard from gouged/chipped plank; seam gaps may worsen with movement.
- Potential need for plank replacement if damage is widespread.

Recommendations:
- Inspect moisture source and test subfloor for moisture content.
- Replace damaged planks (or patch with matching veneer/repair system) and reseal/refinish as needed.
- Verify and restore proper expansion gaps and seam integrity after repair.
- If multiple boards are affected, evaluate scope for partial vs. full floor replacement by a flooring professional.
