Location:
- Ceiling vent (rectangular grille) in interior ceiling.

Observations:
- White rectangular vent grille with multiple horizontal blades.
- Flush-mounted in textured ceiling; two screws securing frame (left and right).
- Small gap around the frame edge observable.
- A small loose string/cord at the left edge of the vent.

Potential Issues:
- Loose/dangling string or cord at left edge (unusual accessory; potential damper/trim issue).
- Gap around frame may allow air leakage and reduced efficiency.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and secure the vent frame; tighten screws if needed.
- Remove or properly secure the dangling cord; verify damper mechanism if present.
- Seal gaps with appropriate caulk or trim as needed to reduce air leakage.
- Clean blades and inspect for any moisture staining or mold during routine maintenance.
