Location:
- Exterior wooden fence, lower section at grade

Observations:
- Vertical wood pickets, weathered/gray
- Bottom edges in contact with soil/vegetation
- Several pickets split, broken, and partially missing at lower ends
- Visible screw/nail holes; some fasteners present
- Bottom rail visible behind pickets near ground

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/splits and broken wood on multiple pickets
- Gaps/voids at bottom allowing passage; separations between pickets and rail
- Wood decay/rot and frayed/splintered edges at lower ends
- Warping/bowing of pickets
- Loose/missing fasteners; some surface corrosion on remaining screws/nails
- Finish/sealant failed; bare wood exposed
- Vegetation/soil contact promotes moisture retention and deterioration
- Potential pest/pet entry points through lower openings
- Minor mildew/algae evident near ground

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted/split/missing pickets; repair/replace any compromised bottom rail
- Re-secure with galvanized/exterior-rated fasteners; replace corroded hardware
- Trim vegetation and maintain clearance from soil; improve drainage at base (gravel gap if feasible)
- Clean and treat for mildew; apply exterior wood preservative/stain/sealant after repairs
- Evaluate full fence for similar deterioration; consider sectional or full replacement if widespread
