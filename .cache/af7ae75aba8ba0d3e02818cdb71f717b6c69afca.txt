Location:
- Exterior wall foundation area where stucco/paint meets brick veneer; vertical PVC condensate/drain pipe along the wall with a 90Â° elbow at the wall and a loose elbow piece on the ground.

Observations:
- White PVC drain/condensate pipe shows green algae/moss staining along its length and at the base.
- Elbow fitting at wall penetration appears to be paired with a vertical run to ground; bottom end near soil has moisture staining.
- Another PVC elbow piece is lying on the ground near the base.
- Wall finish shows peeling paint and surface cracking near the base; substrate exposed in spots.
- Moss, soil, and small plants growing at foundation level; vegetation in contact with foundation.
- Concrete/stone at ground surface shows pitting and moss growth.
- Adjacent brick has minor mortar/edge wear visible.

Potential Issues:
- Moisture intrusion potential from wall/foundation due to staining, peeling paint, and algae/moss.
- Likely disconnected or improperly connected condensate drain (loose elbow on ground) risking leaks/backflow.
- Unsealed pipe penetrations and gaps that could allow pests or water intrusion.
- Vegetation in contact with foundation can retain moisture and may cause root intrusion or wall deterioration.
- Surface deterioration of foundation/concrete at grade (pitting and moss growth) that could worsen over time.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and reconnect/secure condensate drain; ensure proper slope away from wall and seal penetration with exterior sealant; replace missing elbow if needed.
- Seal penetrations around pipes; reseal or recoat peeling stucco and repair surface cracks.
- Remove or trim back vegetation and keep at least 12 inches of clearance from the wall; address moisture buildup.
- Clean and treat moss/algae; monitor for ongoing dampness.
- Verify grading and downspout drainage directs water away from foundation; adjust as needed.
- If moisture persists or interior signs appear, consider further inspection of interior walls and foundation for potential mold or structural issues.
