Location:
- Under kitchen sink cabinet, near the drain.

Observations:
- White PVC drain with P-trap visible; horizontal trap arm to wall with a 90Â° elbow.
- Debris/leaves cluttering the bottom of the cabinet.
- Cables/wires present in background.

Potential Issues:
- Debris accumulation in cabinet (pest/moisture risk; may conceal leaks).
- Drain configuration appears nonstandard (elbow directly into wall rather than a typical trap adapter); potential leak risk and future service difficulty.
- No visible active leak, but joints/seals not clearly verifiable from photo.

Recommendations:
- Clear debris; keep cabinet dry; consider lining to reduce moisture/pest risk.
- Have a plumber reconfigure the drain to a standard trap adapter with proper slip-joint connections, ensure correct trap arm slope (about 1/4 inch per foot).
- Inspect for leaks after running water; replace worn washers/gaskets if any seepage is found.
- If moisture stains or mold are found, remediate and address source.
