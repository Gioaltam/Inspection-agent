Location:
- Exterior alcove/side yard next to stucco wall, small steps, and window; beneath/within large palm.

Observations:
- Stucco exterior wall; small concrete/masonry steps.
- Wood-framed window; finish weathered.
- Large palm and dead fronds in direct contact with wall/window.
- Bare, damp soil and organic debris against foundation; green growth at base of wall.
- Narrow/obstructed passage; loose items (folding chair, debris).

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting structure; blocked access and pest pathways.
- Trip/fall hazards: uneven muddy ground, debris, low-hanging fronds; steps lack handrail.
- Stucco shows hairline cracks and staining near base.
- Window frame paint deteriorated; likely failed/missing caulk at perimeter; possible substrate exposure.
- Poor drainage/soil against foundation; moisture staining/biological growth indicates chronic dampness.

Recommendations:
- Prune/remove palm and dead fronds; maintain 1â€“2 ft clearance from wall and window.
- Remove debris and create a clear, level walking surface; provide head clearance.
- Install a compliant handrail for the steps.
- Seal/caulk window perimeter; prep/paint window frame; repair any rot as needed.
- Fill/patch stucco cracks; seal and repaint.
- Regrade to slope soil away from foundation; add drainage improvements as needed.
- Monitor for pests; seal any gaps found around window or wall penetrations.
