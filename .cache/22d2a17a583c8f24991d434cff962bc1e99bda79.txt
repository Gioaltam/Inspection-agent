Location:
- Interior room; window wall beside small refrigerator; terrarium on bench/table

Observations:
- Single/double-hung window with mini-blinds; lower sash appears open; no screen visible
- Daylight visible at lower portion of window; gaps around sash/frame likely
- Mini-blind slats bent/misaligned
- Terrarium on narrow bench; positioned close to window
- Tile floor; pans/bags/clutter on floor near walkway

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at window and missing screen create pest entry and drafts; potential water intrusion
- Window partially blocked by large terrarium/furniture; obstructs operation and emergency egress
- Trip/fall hazard from trays/bags/clutter on floor
- Bent/damaged blinds (minor)
- Possible separation at wall/ceiling joint near window (small gap line visible)
- No visible water stains, mold, or corrosion

Recommendations:
- Close/align window; install/repair insect screen; seal/caulk and weatherstrip gaps; verify smooth operation and locking
- Reposition/secure terrarium on a sturdy, appropriately sized stand; keep window fully accessible
- Remove floor clutter; maintain clear walking path
- Repair/replace damaged blinds as desired
- Patch any wall/ceiling joint separations and repaint; monitor for movement or moisture signs
