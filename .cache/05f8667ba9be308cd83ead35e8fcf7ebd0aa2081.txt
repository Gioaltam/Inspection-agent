Location:
- Kitchen upper wall cabinet above stacked plates

Observations:
- Painted wood cabinet/door with aged finish
- Heavy grime/grease and dark staining on surfaces
- Paint blistering, cracking, peeling; chipping at lower edge
- Bottom edge shows swelling/delamination; bare substrate visible
- Large gap between door and face frame; door appears out of plane
- Metal handle tarnished/corroded

Potential Issues:
- Misalignment/door not closing; gap/separation at door-frame
- Paint failure with substrate exposure; splintered/chipped edge
- Water staining and swollen wood consistent with moisture damage; possible rot
- Corrosion on handle hardware
- Possible mildew/microbial staining on door surface
- Hygiene concern over dish storage; falling paint/debris risk

Recommendations:
- Adjust/replace hinges and realign door to close properly
- Replace damaged door/sections if wood is soft/rotted; consider cabinet replacement if widespread
- Clean/degrease thoroughly; sand, prime, and repaint with kitchen-grade enamel
- Replace corroded handle/hardware
- Inspect for and correct any nearby moisture source; dry area
- Sanitize cabinet and relocate dishware until repairs/cleaning are complete
