Location:
- Exterior wood siding wall; window on a single story (or lower level) of the house.

Observations:
- Red painted wood siding with extensive peeling/chipping paint.
- White window trim with severe paint failure and cracking.
- Window sill showing moisture staining and visible deterioration/rot.
- Gaps/caulk deterioration around window frame.
- White conduit/piping run along wall below window.

Potential Issues:
- Rot/decay at window sill and bottom trim.
- Moisture intrusion risk from failed caulk and paint, potential interior mold/rot.
- Substrate exposure behind deteriorated trim/sill.
- Gaps/voids around window allowing water/Pest entry.
- Improper or aging flashing/installation not visible but suspected.
- Electrical conduit near moisture area (potential code/conduit protection concerns).

Recommendations:
- Replace or repair rotten sill and damaged trim; install proper exterior flashing.
- Scrape, prime, and repaint trim and affected siding; reseal around window with exterior-grade caulk.
- Inspect interior for leaks; repair any gaps to prevent water intrusion; evaluate need for window replacement for better sealing/energy efficiency.
- Ensure conduit is properly secured and protected; verify clearances around wall openings.
