Location:
- Under-sink cabinet area (kitchen).

Observations:
- White corrugated plastic drain hose present near PVC P-trap; beige plastic clamp on hose.
- PVC/white trap assembly visible with standard fittings.
- Stainless steel braided water-supply line with shutoff/tag visible.
- Rough/open hole in cabinet back wall near plumbing; clutter (clothes) in the space.
  
Potential Issues:
- Dishwasher drain hose appears not looped high or connected to an air gap (backflow/Code issue).
- Connection of the corrugated hose to the drain/trap area may be marginal or improvised (possible leak).
- Opening in back wall/cabinet area could allow moisture intrusion or pests.
- Visible moisture staining or corrosion not clearly evident, but potential leak risk if fittings are loose.

Recommendations:
- Create a proper high loop or install an air gap for the dishwasher drain; secure to underside of counter.
- Inspect, reseal or replace the dishwasher drain hose and clamps; ensure a proper connection to the disposal/trap.
- Seal the back-wall opening with appropriate grommet/caulk to prevent moisture/pest intrusion; address any underlying moisture.
- Test under operation for leaks; tighten or replace any suspect fittings as needed.
