Location:
- Exterior condenser unit nameplate (ground level, surrounded by plants)

Observations:
- International Comfort Products A/C, model CAC030AKA5 (approx. 2.5 ton)
- Serial E031954283 (ICP format indicates 2003 manufacture)
- 208/230V, 1 ph, 60 Hz; MCA 18.9A; Max fuse/breaker 30A
- Refrigerant: R-22; factory charge ~74 oz
- Rating label weathered/faded
- Vegetation touching/very close to cabinet

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with unit—blocked airflow and service access; overheating risk; pest harborage
- R-22 refrigerant (phased out)—limited/expensive servicing if leaks occur
- Age ~2003—beyond typical service life; higher failure/inefficiency likelihood
- Rating label partially degraded—may become unreadable for servicing/compliance

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove vegetation to maintain 12–24 in. side clearance and clear above the fan
- Have a licensed HVAC technician service/evaluate operation and coil cleanliness; budget for replacement due to age/R-22
- Verify electrical OCPD and conductors match nameplate (≤30A breaker, wiring sized for ≥18.9A MCA)
- Replace/protect label if it becomes illegible for code/servicing purposes
