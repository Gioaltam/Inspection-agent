Location:
- Exterior ground-mounted air-conditioner condenser; adjacent to vegetation

Observations:
- Manufacturer: International Comfort Products (ICP); outdoor A/C condenser
- Model: CAC030AKA5; Serial: E031954283 (likely 2003 manufacture)
- Refrigerant: R-22; factory/ship charge listed 74 oz
- Electrical: 208/230V 1φ; MCA 18.9A; Max fuse/CB 30A
- Fan 1/5 HP; data plate present but weathered/faded
- Unit partially obscured by plants/foliage

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with cabinet—restricts airflow and access; can trap moisture and promote corrosion
- Data plate partially illegible—may hinder servicing/verification
- No other visible dents, cracks, gaps, loose/missing parts, corrosion, wiring defects, or leak stains from this view

Recommendations:
- Trim/clear vegetation; maintain ~12–24 in clearance around and ~5 ft above unit
- Clean exterior coil and cabinet after clearing vegetation
- Record data-plate info; replace/label as needed if it becomes unreadable
- Because unit uses R-22 and appears older, have a licensed HVAC contractor evaluate performance and discuss replacement planning
