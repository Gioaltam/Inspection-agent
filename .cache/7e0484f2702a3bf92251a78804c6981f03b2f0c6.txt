Location:
- Bathroom vanity sink area, with mirror above.

Observations:
- White laminate counter with undermount sink; chrome two-handle faucet.
- Soap dispenser on left; cabinet doors below with metal pulls.
- Small light stain/spot on the front edge of the counter near the center.
- A seam/edge at the back of the counter adjacent to the wall; caulk/sealant not clearly visible.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected missing/cracked caulk along the backsplash/back edge (water intrusion risk).
- Countertop stain or residue that may indicate moisture exposure.
- No visible leaks at the moment; under-sink area not visible for moisture/mold assessment.

Recommendations:
- Re-seal back edge with fresh caulk to prevent water intrusion.
- Clean the countertop stain; monitor for recurrence; consider replacing top if staining persists.
- Inspect under-sink cabinet for any signs of moisture, mold, or leaks; verify shut-off valves are accessible.
