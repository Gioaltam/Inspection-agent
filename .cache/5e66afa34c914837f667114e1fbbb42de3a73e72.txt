Location:
- Utility closet/mechanical space with louvered door; ceiling/wall near exterior wall.

Observations:
- Pleated filter rated 18x20x1 is visibly dirty and partially clogged.
- Metal HVAC cabinet shows dust/grime; bottom area has staining/dirt.
- Flexible foil ducting attached to left side; white condensate drain line visible near bottom; some loose-looking wiring/lines at base.
- Debris on floor under unit; cabinet edges show minor corrosion/dirt.

Potential Issues:
- Filter is dirty and may restrict airflow and efficiency.
- Possible condensate line/pan risk if drain is blocked (potential water intrusion or mold risk).
- Duct connections/seams may be loose or not fully sealed.
- Visible rust/dirt on cabinet; potential corrosion in enclosure.
- Floor debris and clutter could indicate moisture exposure or pest access risk.
- Wiring/line-set not clearly secured.

Recommendations:
- Replace filter with correct size and ensure snug seal.
- Inspect and clear condensate drain line/pan; verify proper slope and floor drain or condensate disposal.
- Inspect duct connections for leaks; reseal as needed with appropriate tape/mastic.
- Clean interior and address any rust or corrosion; consider protective coating if needed.
- Organize and secure wiring/lines; ensure access panel remains closed and safe.
- If moisture signs persist or mold suspected, call HVAC pro for a full inspection and sanitation.
