Location:
- Interior of under-sink base cabinet

Observations:
- Painted wood cabinet base and back panel with seam at center
- Flexible metallic conduit (armored) routed through base; strapped near floor
- Corrugated hose with worm-gear clamp at right pass-through; patch plates present
- Two pipe penetrations with escutcheons at upper back
- Debris and surface staining on cabinet floor

Potential Issues:
- Cracks and separations in back panel; chipped/exposed substrate
- Gaps/voids around conduit, hose/pipe penetrations, and along cabinet base
- Water stains on cabinet floor indicating past moisture
- Corrosion on flexible metallic conduit; taped/abraded section suggests damage
- Conduit appears to pass through rough opening without proper connector/bushing or junction box (potential improper wiring)
- Misaligned/loose patch plates at right penetration leaving gaps
- Possible pest entry points at unsealed openings

Recommendations:
- Clean interior; operate faucet/disposal/dishwasher and check for active leaks; repair any leaking fittings/clamps
- Seal all gaps/penetrations with appropriate sealant/escutcheons; close pest entry points
- Licensed electrician to evaluate/repair or replace damaged/corroded flexible metallic conduit; install proper connectors/bushings and junction box; ensure required GFCI protection
- Refasten/realign patch plates; add gaskets as needed
- Refinish or replace cabinet floor if stained/swollen; consider liner or leak pan and leak detector
