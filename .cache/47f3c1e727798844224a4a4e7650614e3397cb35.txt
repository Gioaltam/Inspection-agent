Location:
- Bathroom vanity area with sink, mirror, and open/ajar louvered cabinet; adjacent toilet.

Observations:
- Large wall mirror over sink; white laminate vanity with oval sink; chrome two-handle faucet.
- Counter clutter: cleaning jug, toothpaste, toothbrush, pink bottle, etc.
- Open/ajar white louvered cabinet on the right.
- Electrical outlet on the wall with a cord plugged in and a cord running along the wall/floor.
- Trash can and items near toilet; tile floor.
- Interior of the sink basin shows some staining.

Potential Issues:
- Electrical outlet in splash zone with visible cord; potential shock hazard.
- Extension cord/cords in bathroom area; trip and moisture risk.
- Cabinet door is ajar; moisture exposure risk and accessibility issue.
- Potential gaps/caulk deterioration around sink perimeter (water intrusion risk).
- Sink basin staining could indicate mineral buildup or moisture exposure (monitor for mold if moisture persists).

Recommendations:
- Ensure outlet is GFCI-protected and relocate/remove cords from splash zone.
- Tidy/secure cords; avoid routing along floor near water.
- Close the cabinet door; inspect hinges/fasteners for proper security.
- Re-caulk around the sink perimeter to seal gaps and prevent water intrusion.
- Clean/neutralize basin staining; check for leaks around faucet/drain and monitor for moisture/mold.
