- Ceiling exhaust vent cover (white plastic) with multiple louvers; mounted to drywall.  
- Dust/dirt buildup on blades and inside the vent; limited airflow likely affected over time.  
- Small paint chip/imperfection on the ceiling just above the vent.  
- Screws securing the cover are visible; no loose hardware observed.  
- Recommendation: remove and clean the vent/blades, inspect for moisture or mold, and verify the exhaust fan operates correctly.
