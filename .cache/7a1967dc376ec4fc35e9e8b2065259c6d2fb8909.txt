Location: Back/side exterior door (interior view)

What I See:
- Door hardware area with a cover plate where a deadbolt likely used to be; only a knob is installed.
- Door jamb has missing/damaged strike/lock hardware and a broken chain lock, with rough cutouts in the wood.

Issues to Address:
- Missing/damaged strike plate/lock hardware on the jamb; wood is gouged.
- Broken/missing security chain.

Recommended Action:
- Have a locksmith/carpenter install a proper exterior lockset and deadbolt. Fit a new strike plate and align the latch so the door secures properly.
- Patch the old cutouts with wood filler/epoxy, sand, prime, and paint.
- Replace the chain with a modern door guard if additional secondary security is desired.
