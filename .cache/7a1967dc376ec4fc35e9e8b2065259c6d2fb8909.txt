Location: Exterior door (interior view)

What I See:
- Latch strike plate on the jamb is missing; wood around the latch area looks chewed/splintered.
- Prior deadbolt hole on the door is capped with a blank cover (no deadbolt installed).

Issues to Address:
- Missing latch strike plate.
- Damaged/splintered jamb at the latch area.

Recommended Action:
- Install a proper strike plate and reinforce the latch area. Repair the jamb with wood epoxy/filler or replace the damaged section; fasten the strike with 3-inch screws into the framing.
- After repair, check latch alignment and adjust so the door closes and locks smoothly.
- Optional for security: install a new deadbolt where the hole is capped.
