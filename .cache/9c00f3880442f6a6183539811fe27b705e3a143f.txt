Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (kitchen/bath), rear wall and cabinet floor

Observations:
- PVC tailpiece with slip-joint P-trap; side branch drain to left
- Two braided supply lines with angle stop valves at wall
- Cement board panel placed on cabinet floor; unfinished edges
- Stains and mineral deposits on trap/tailpiece and on floor
- Wall penetrations around pipes unsealed; missing escutcheons

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at shutoff valves and pipe supports
- Water stains/mineral deposits indicating current or past leaks at trap/tailpiece joints and around valves
- Suspected mold/mildew on wall/floor surfaces near penetrations and base
- Gaps/voids around wall penetrations; potential pest entry and moisture intrusion
- Cabinet/base floor shows discoloration and possible swelling/warping from moisture
- Failed/missing caulk/sealant at wall-floor joint and around penetrations
- Substrate exposure (raw cement board edges and cabinet floor)

Recommendations:
- Operate faucet and inspect under load; repair/replace leaking trap/tailpiece washers and connections as needed
- Replace corroded shutoff valves and clean/replace supply lines if compromised
- Clean, dry, and disinfect; evaluate for moldâ€”remove/replace any water-damaged materials
- Seal gaps at wall penetrations with appropriate escutcheons and caulk; seal wall-floor joint
- Consider replacing or properly finishing/protecting the cabinet floor (or install waterproof pan)
- Monitor after repairs for any recurring moisture signs
