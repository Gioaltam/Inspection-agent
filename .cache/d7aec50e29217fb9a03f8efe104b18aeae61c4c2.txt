Location:
- Small utility closet/alcove with HVAC lines overhead

Observations:
- Electric tank-style water heater; top copper supply lines with shutoff valves
- Flexible metal electrical whip from wall box to heater
- No drain pan; tank sits directly on tile in a floor cutout with foam around base
- Refrigerant line above with torn/taped insulation
- Dark staining on ceiling/joists above unit
- Tight/limited service clearance; loose panel/boards stored beside tank
- TPR valve/discharge piping not visible from this angle

Potential Issues:
- No drain pan/drain observed; water damage risk
- Gaps/voids around base and floor cutout; potential water intrusion/pest entry
- Moisture staining and possible mold on wood above; indicates leak/history of dampness
- Deteriorated insulation on refrigerant line; likely condensate drip source
- TPR discharge line not visible; potentially missing/unsafe relief piping
- Tank not seismically strapped (if required)
- Electrical whip connection at heater not clearly secured; loose/abandoned wire hanging above (improper wiring hazard)
- Limited working space; clutter creates blocked/unsafe conditions and trip hazards

Recommendations:
- Install code-compliant drain pan with plumbed drain or leak sensor
- Seal/repair floor and wall penetrations around base; pest-proof
- Investigate/repair source of moisture above (HVAC condensate/plumbing); clean and remediate any mold; replace damaged materials
- Replace/restore insulation on refrigerant line to prevent condensation
- Have a licensed plumber verify presence and routing of TPR valve/discharge; install/repair as needed and test valve
- Add seismic straps per local code (if applicable)
- Have a licensed electrician secure proper connectors/strain relief for the whip, verify grounding/bonding, and remove/terminate abandoned wire safely
- Clear area for safe service access; remove stored materials nearby
