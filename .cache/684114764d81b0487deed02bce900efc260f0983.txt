Location:
- HVAC return plenum/filter rack at air handler (mechanical area)

Observations:
- Metal return plenum with V-style filter rack; filters labeled 14x18x1
- Front filter heavily loaded with dust; cardboard frame distorted
- Filters appear misaligned in tracks; visible edge gaps
- Interior metal surfaces dusty with light oxidation
- Wood platform below shows discoloration/debris

Potential Issues:
- Severely clogged filter restricting airflow; efficiency/performance impact
- Misalignment and edge gaps allow unfiltered air bypass
- Bent/crushed filter frame; risk of collapse/blow-by
- Possible two 1-in filters in series; may create excessive static pressure if not designed
- Light corrosion on rack/metal surfaces
- Debris accumulation in plenum
- Staining on adjacent wood; possible prior moisture
- Filter rails/retainers appear bent/warped

Recommendations:
- Replace filters now with correct size/MERV per equipment; ensure single or designed configuration
- Seat filters fully; add/repair gasketing to eliminate bypass; secure retainers
- Straighten/repair or replace filter rack/rails
- Clean plenum and surrounding area; consider duct cleaning if contamination is widespread
- Seal any air leaks at seams with HVAC mastic/foil tape
- Treat light rust; clean and apply rust-inhibiting coating
- Investigate source of staining/moisture; correct and monitor
- Have HVAC technician evaluate airflow/static pressure and overall system operation
