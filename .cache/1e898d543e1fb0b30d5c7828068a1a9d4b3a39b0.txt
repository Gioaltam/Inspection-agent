Location:
- Interior corner at floor level, base of wall near a gray cabinet/appliance.

Observations:
- Peeling and rough, flaky paint/finish on wall.
- Visible exposed wood at the base where wall meets floor; appears deteriorated/rotted.
- Crumbling substrate where wall/trim meets the floor; gap present.
- No visible active water stain on the surface, but signs of moisture exposure and deterioration at the base.

Potential Issues:
- Wood rot/dungal moisture damage at the base framing.
- Possible hidden mold/mildew in rotted area.
- Structural concern if rot extends into studs or bottom plate.
- Missing/separated sealant and damaged trim; potential moisture ingress path.
- Substrate exposure creating trip/slip hazard if debris remains.

Recommendations:
- Investigate and remedy moisture source (plumbing, exterior leak, or poor drainage).
- Remove and replace rotted wood; treat surrounding framing; reseal joints.
- Repair/replace baseboard trim; seal with appropriate caulk and finish.
- Dry-out area and inspect for mold; remediate if found.
- Have a professional assess structural integrity of the bottom wall/plate if rot appears extensive.
