Location:
- Under kitchen sink base cabinet

Observations:
- Tubular metal drain assembly: sink strainer, tailpiece with side tee, P‑trap, trap arm to wall
- Heavy mineral deposits and corrosion on strainer body, slip‑joint nuts, and piping
- Storage of bottles/containers; open container with standing dark water below trap
- Limited visibility of cabinet floor due to stored items

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leak evidence at multiple joints and strainer; container catching water
- Corrosion/rust on drain components; potential weakening/perforation
- Likely deteriorated/failed washers/caulk at slip joints/strainer
- Blocked/unsafe conditions from clutter and chemicals; obstructed access
- Conditions conducive to mold/mildew and pests due to standing water/moisture

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber evaluate, leak‑test, and replace corroded tubular drain parts and sink strainer; install new washers/gaskets and reseal strainer
- Consider upgrading to PVC trap/tailpieces; ensure proper alignment and tight slip joints
- Remove standing water; clean, dry, and disinfect cabinet; monitor for renewed leaks
- Clear and organize storage; keep chemicals sealed/upright; add a drip tray
- Inspect cabinet base for hidden water damage; repair/replace if deteriorated
