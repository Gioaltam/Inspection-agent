Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (lavatory/kitchen)

Observations:
- PVC/ABS slip-joint P-trap with white trap and gray trap arm/branch
- Vertical tailpiece with slip coupling/extension
- Two angle-stop valves with braided stainless supply lines
- Large wall cutout around plumbing filled with expanding spray foam
- Towels/soft goods stored in cabinet and contacting piping
- Small vinyl tube off a tee at a supply valve (likely filter/aux line)

Potential Issues:
- Trap arm rises immediately after the P-trap (up-slope), which can create an S-trap effect and siphoning/slow drainage
- Rough wall opening has irregular spray-foam fill with remaining gaps/voids; foam partly covers valve bodies, reducing serviceability and hiding leaks
- Storage crowds the area and contacts slip-joint fittings, which can stress joints and conceal leaks
- No visible active leaks, corrosion, cracks, or mold at time of photo

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber reconfigure the trap arm to maintain proper horizontal slope to the wall and confirm proper venting; use smooth, rigid components
- Trim/redo sealing at wall penetration; fully seal gaps with appropriate material and keep shutoff valves accessible (install escutcheons if desired)
- Clear the cabinet; keep items off piping and consider a leak tray or alarm
- Monitor periodically for leaks at slip-joint connections and supply valves
