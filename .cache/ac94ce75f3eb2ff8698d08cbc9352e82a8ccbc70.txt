Location:
- Under-cabinet/desk corner along wall and countertop

Observations:
- Painted wood trim/panel with exposed cut edges and rough joints
- Visible gap where vertical panel separates from wall
- Unsealed joint between trim and countertop; debris present
- Power cord routed through drilled hole/notch in trim; loose two‑prong plug lying nearby
- Under‑cabinet light fixture shows surface staining/corrosion

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids/separations at panel-to-wall and trim-to-counter joints
- Panel appears loose/misaligned; likely missing/loose fasteners
- Failed/missing caulk; substrate exposure at seams and cut edges
- Improper wiring/cord routing through wood without grommet/strain relief; abrasion/shock hazard
- Loose plug component present; potential electrical hazard if energized/misused
- Corrosion/rust on under-cabinet light fixture; possible moisture exposure and electrical risk
- Possible pest entry points at open gaps

Recommendations:
- Re-secure panel/trim; add appropriate fasteners/shims; align
- Seal all joints and cut edges with paintable caulk; touch up paint
- Clean debris; monitor for moisture; investigate and correct any source
- Add grommet/strain relief bushing for cord or reroute properly; have a licensed electrician evaluate and correct cord/outlet/light fixture
- Replace corroded under-cabinet fixture as needed; verify GFCI protection if within 6 ft of a sink
- Implement pest exclusion by sealing voids fully
