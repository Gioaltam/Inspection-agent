Location:
- Exterior mini‑split outdoor condenser, side service/line‑set area

Observations:
- Label visible: R410A refrigerant; 208/230V, 60Hz, 1Ph; MCA 19A; MOP 30A (model CH9MSHP‑230V0)
- Refrigerant line‑set wrapped with white UV tape/foam insulation
- Green staining/biological growth on cabinet and insulation surfaces

Potential Issues:
- Line‑set insulation shows cracking/tears and separations; sections appear UV‑degraded
- Mildew/algae present on cabinet/insulation (moisture exposure)
- No visible dents, bends, warping, misalignment, loose/missing fasteners, corrosion/rust, exposed wiring/conduit issues, or trip hazards from this view

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair damaged suction‑line insulation with UV‑rated material; re‑wrap and seal seams
- Clean cabinet and line‑set; treat for mildew/algae; improve drainage/clearance as needed
- Seal any gaps at line‑set entries with UV‑stable grommets/caulk to deter water/pests
- Have a licensed HVAC technician evaluate lines, service valves, and electrical connections and verify proper operation and refrigerant charge
