Location:
- Utility/mechanical closet housing a bottom-front access air handler/furnace with a visible pleated filter.

Observations:
- Front filter is pleated and appears dusty/dirty.
- Metal cabinet with service labels and diagram stickers; screws securing panels present.
- Wiring along left side appears exposed/loose to the side of the unit.
- No obvious water stains, mold, or rust visible on the exterior.

Potential Issues:
- Clogged/dirty filter causing airflow restriction and reduced efficiency.
- Wiring along left side may be improperly secured or exposed (potential electrical safety concern).
- Overall aging appearance; no visible leaks, but condition warrants inspection.

Recommendations:
- Replace the filter with the correct size and ensure it seats properly to seal.
- Have a licensed HVAC tech inspect wiring/terminals, ensure proper enclosure, and confirm safe operation.
- Consider routine maintenance and cabinet cleaning; inspect for any signs of corrosion or leaks during service.
