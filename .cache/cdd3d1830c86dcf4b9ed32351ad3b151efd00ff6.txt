Location:
- Ceiling-mounted HVAC register/grille (room not specified)

Observations:
- Rectangular metal louvered grille, painted white
- Heavy dark dust/soot buildup on louvers and inner edges
- Minor louver misalignment/bending at bottom section
- Perimeter shows uneven caulk/paint with small gaps at ceiling interface
- Localized discoloration consistent with early surface corrosion on grille

Potential Issues:
- Airflow restriction and indoor air quality concern from heavy particulate buildup
- Gaps at register-to-ceiling junction may allow air leakage and draw dust from cavity; potential small pest entry path
- Early surface corrosion on grille
- Minor bent/misaligned louvers

Recommendations:
- Remove and thoroughly clean grille; replace if corrosion or damage persists
- Replace/upgrade HVAC filter; confirm proper fit and schedule regular changes
- Have HVAC contractor inspect system/ducts for debris accumulation; consider duct cleaning if warranted
- Reseal perimeter to ceiling with paintable caulk/foam tape and secure with appropriate screws; ensure grille sits flush
- Monitorâ€”if staining returns quickly, have tech check for humidity/condensation or pressure/filtration imbalance
