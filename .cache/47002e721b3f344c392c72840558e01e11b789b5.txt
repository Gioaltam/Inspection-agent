Location:
- Interior ceiling/wall corner with popcorn texture; near a vertical edge/ledge.

Observations:
- Popcorn ceiling texture with several peeling patches.
- Exposed substrate/drywall in patches.
- Brown staining around peeling areas.
- Small cracks and rough patches adjacent to the damaged zone.

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/moisture damage indicated by peeling paint and stains.
- Possible mold/mildew behind damaged texture.
- Drywall/plaster compromise at the joint.
- If ceiling is pre-1980s popcorn, potential asbestos risk (testing advised before disturbed).

Recommendations:
- Identify and repair moisture source (roof leak or plumbing above).
- Dry out area; assess for mold and remediate if found.
- Remove/repair damaged drywall or plaster, reseal joints, retexture, and repaint.
- Consider asbestos testing if ceiling is suspected to be old popcorn before any removal.
