Location:
- Exterior side elevation below shallow eave/soffit

Observations:
- Vinyl lap siding; two metal-framed windows
- Vented vinyl soffit with painted fascia; no gutters observed
- Heavy vegetation and stacked tires/debris against wall

Potential Issues:
- Overgrown vegetation and stored tires/debris against siding; moisture retention, pest harborage, trip/fall hazard
- Window perimeters show separations/failed or missing caulk; visible gaps at trim
- Dark staining at fascia/soffit and above windows; possible mildew and moisture exposure
- Siding shows localized waviness/possible minor warping near windows
- Windows partially obstructed by storage; blocked egress/maintenance access
- Potential pest entry points at window gaps

Recommendations:
- Remove debris/tires and clear vegetation 12â€“18 in. from siding; grade and keep area dry
- Clean mildew/staining on soffit/fascia; evaluate for rot; repair and repaint/seal as needed
- Reseal/caulk around window perimeters; add or repair head flashing/drip cap if missing; check for leaks
- Repair/replace any warped or damaged vinyl panels and loose trim/J-channel
- Consider adding gutters/downspouts to manage roof runoff away from foundation
- Inspect for pests and seal entry points
