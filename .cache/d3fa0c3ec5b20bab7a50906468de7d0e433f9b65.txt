Location:
- Exterior wall under eave with two windows; yard area in front of wall

Observations:
- Horizontal vinyl siding; vented vinyl soffit; painted fascia
- Two metal-framed windows; perimeter sealant/weatherstripping appears aged
- No gutters visible at roof edge
- Heavy vegetation and stored tires/debris stacked against wall and under windows
- Dark staining at fascia/soffit and around window trims

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids and failed/missing caulk around window perimeters
- Water staining/discoloration at fascia/soffit indicating moisture exposure
- Possible siding warping/misalignment in areas near windows
- Organic growth/mildew on siding/trim surfaces
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: windows obstructed by stored items; limited egress and access
- Trip/fall hazards from scattered tires and debris
- Pest/rodent/insect harborage and entry risks due to vegetation, debris, and perimeter gaps
- Splashback risk at foundation/wall due to absence of gutters

Recommendations:
- Remove tires/debris and cut vegetation back at least 12â€“18 in from siding; maintain clear window egress
- Clean siding/trim; treat for mildew; monitor for recurring moisture
- Re-caulk and seal around both windows; repair/replace deteriorated trim as needed
- Evaluate siding for warping/misalignment; resecure/replace affected panels
- Inspect fascia/soffit for moisture damage; repair, seal, and paint
- Consider installing gutters/downspouts to control roof runoff
- Pest control assessment after cleanup; seal any entry points
- Check interior below these areas for signs of water intrusion and repair if found
