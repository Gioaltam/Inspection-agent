Location:
- Kitchen wall cabinet (upper), above countertop.

Observations:
- White-painted cabinet door with heavy brown staining and dirt along bottom edge.
- Peeling/chipped paint at bottom edge; possible moisture exposure.
- Rust/corrosion on the door pull hardware and mounting screws.
- Visible gap/edge wear at the cabinet edge near the seam with adjacent surface.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected moisture damage/wood rot at the bottom edge.
- Hardware corrosion and potential loose/misaligned fasteners.
- Surface delamination or compromised finish increasing risk of further moisture intrusion.

Recommendations:
- Inspect for and repair any active moisture source (leak from sink/pipe); dry area thoroughly.
- Replace or repair damaged cabinet bottom panel; reseal edges; consider repainting.
- Replace corroded hardware and confirm fasteners are secure; re-caulk/finish to prevent water intrusion.
- If moisture-prone, consider moisture-rated cabinet material or relocation of this cabinet area; monitor for expansion, mold, or mildew.
