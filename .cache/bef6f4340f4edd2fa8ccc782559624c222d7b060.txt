Location:
- Exterior, ground-mounted AC condensing unit area

Observations:
- Metal condenser cabinet with side intake grilles
- Flexible electrical conduit present; PVC drain/discharge pipe at grade
- Dense grass/vegetation in contact with cabinet and around base
- Visible water pooling/damp soil at base; pad not clearly visible

Potential Issues:
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: vegetation obstructs condenser airflow and service access
- Water intrusion/corrosion risk: standing water at base of unit
- Possible pest harborage due to overgrowth and moisture
- Trip/fall hazard when servicing due to hidden ground/pipe

Recommendations:
- Cut vegetation back 2â€“3 ft around and above unit; maintain clear access
- Verify unit is on a solid, level pad raised above grade; adjust/replace pad as needed
- Redirect/extend condensate/discharge to drain away from unit and foundation; add gravel/splash block to prevent pooling
- Clean condenser coils and cabinet after clearing debris
- Have HVAC technician inspect operation once area is cleared and drainage corrected
