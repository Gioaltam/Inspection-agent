Location:
- Shower stall interior (wall and floor)

Observations:
- Beige marble-look wall tiles; blue small-format floor tiles; center drain.
- Dark moisture staining at base of walls and along lower grout joints.
- Gap/line visible where wall tiles meet floor; looks like missing or degraded caulk/grout at the perimeter.
- Minor edge/chipping along bottom of wall tiles near floor.

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion risk from missing/separated caulk and degraded grout at the base.
- Possible mold/mildew behind wall or at grout joints due to ongoing moisture.
- Suspected waterproofing integrity under tile/pan not verifiable from photo.

Recommendations:
- Clean and re-caulk the base perimeter; re-grout where needed to seal joints.
- Inspect for mold and treat if found; consider moisture barrier assessment behind tiles.
- Verify shower pan waterproofing and drain operation; assess for any leaks or water staining beyond visible area.
- If remodeling, install proper waterproofing (membrane) and replace or reseal as needed.
