Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (drain and supply connections)

Observations:
- White corrugated flexible tailpiece connecting to white tubular P-trap
- Slip-joint nuts at connections; vertical and lower joints visible
- Stainless braided water supply hoses with angle stop valve
- Oversized/rough wall cutout around pipe penetrations; no escutcheons/sealant
- Storage items packed around plumbing

Potential Issues:
- Corrugated flex drain/tailpiece present; ribbed interior restricts flow and is not code in many areas
- Brown staining on flex tube ridges and at joints suggests past moisture/leakage
- Misalignment indicated by reliance on flexible connectors; can stress slip joints
- Large gaps/voids at wall penetrations; potential pest entry and moisture/odor pathway; exposed raw cabinet edge
- Access obstructed by stored items, hindering inspection and increasing damage risk if leaks occur

Recommendations:
- Replace corrugated flex section with properly aligned, rigid smooth-wall tailpiece and P-trap components; ensure correct slope
- Inspect/tighten or replace slip-joint washers; run water and check for active leaks
- Seal wall penetrations (escutcheon plates and appropriate sealant/foam); seal/paint exposed cabinet edges
- Clear/organize cabinet to keep plumbing accessible and dry
- If drainage issues or leaking persist, have a licensed plumber evaluate alignment/venting and overall installation
