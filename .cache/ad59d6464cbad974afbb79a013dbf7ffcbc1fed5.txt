Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (sink plumbing)

Observations:
- PVC P-trap with white corrugated flex tailpiece/extension from sink drain
- Black tailpiece under strainer; several slip-joint nuts/connectors
- Braided stainless water supply hoses to shutoff valves
- No visible active drips or staining on cabinet base at time of photo
- Stored items and an appliance power cord under plumbing

Potential Issues:
- Corrugated/accordion drain connector used; nonstandard, rough interior traps debris and can clog/harbor odors; often not code-compliant
- Visible misalignment between tailpiece and trap requiring flex connector; risk of poor slope/slow drainage
- Multiple slip-joint connections at angles increase leak points/loose joints potential
- Electrical cord routed below drain; potential water contact/unsafe
- Stored items crowd plumbing, may damage lines and block shutoff access

Recommendations:
- Replace flex connector with properly aligned rigid PVC/ABS tailpiece and trap arm; set correct slope; tighten with new washers
- Test all joints for leaks after rework; reseal as needed
- Reroute/elevate electrical cord away from plumbing; confirm outlet is GFCI-protected
- Declutter cabinet to maintain clear access to valves and reduce damage risk
