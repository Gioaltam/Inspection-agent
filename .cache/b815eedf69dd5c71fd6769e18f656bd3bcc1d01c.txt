Location: Interior wall (lower section)

What I See:
- Several patched areas where holes were filled; texture and paint donâ€™t match.
- Light scuffs and a few small nail/screw holes still visible.

Issues to Address:
- Unfinished wall patches (needs sanding/texture/paint to blend).
- Remaining small holes and surface scuffs.

Recommended Action:
- Lightly sand patched spots, apply matching texture if needed, prime, and repaint the wall for a uniform finish.
- Fill any remaining nail holes, spot sand, and include in the repaint.
