Location: Interior wall

What I See:
- Several patched drywall spots with mismatched paint
- Light scuffs and a few small remaining nail/screw holes

Issues to Address:
- Unfinished drywall patches and minor fastener holes

Recommended Action:
- Fill any remaining holes with spackle. Sand and feather all patched areas.
- Prime patched spots and repaint, ideally the whole wall, to achieve a uniform finish and color.
