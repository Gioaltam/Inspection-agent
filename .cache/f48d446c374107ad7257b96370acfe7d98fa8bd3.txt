Location:
- Exterior wooden deck/landing with railing, surface painted gray.

Observations:
- Weathered, peeling paint on multiple boards.
- Cracked/split edge boards with visible gaps.
- Small plant growing in a crack at the edge/joist area.
- Debris on surface; surface boards appear soft in places.
- Posts and railing appear present; bottom area shows join/gap near the deck edge.

Potential Issues:
- Rot/softened wood along outer edge and near the joint (possible structural wood damage).
- Gaps/voids and splitting that can harbor moisture and worsen decay.
- Trip hazard from uneven boards and recessed gaps.
- Vegetation in cracks indicating moisture retention.
- Substructure exposure risk if rot extends to joists/stringers (not fully visible).

Recommendations:
- Replace severely damaged edge boards and any soft/rotted framing.
- Inspect underlying joists/stringers for rot; repair or sister as needed.
- Re-seal/coat deck after cleaning; ensure proper drainage and moisture management.
- Remove vegetation from cracks; fill gaps and secure fasteners/boards.
- Re-check railing attachments for security and proper mounting. Consider a professional deck inspection if structural concern persists.
