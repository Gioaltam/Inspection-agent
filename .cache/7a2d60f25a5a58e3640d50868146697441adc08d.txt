Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (kitchen)

Observations:
- PVC slip-joint P-trap with vertical sanitary tee
- Braided stainless supply lines; one shutoff valve visible
- Corrugated flexible drain hose entering back wall, hose-clamped to plastic stub
- Cabinet base/back with staining and worn/peeling finish; metal patch plates at wall penetration
- Debris present on cabinet floor

Potential Issues:
- Water stains on cabinet base/back; evidence of prior leak
- Gaps/voids around wall penetration; no seal/escutcheon—pest entry point possible
- Back/bottom panel shows substrate exposure, cracking, and minor warping/delamination
- Flexible drain line routed low with no visible high loop/air gap—potential backflow/unsanitary connection (likely dishwasher/aux drain)
- Possible mildew staining on interior surfaces (not confirmed)

Recommendations:
- Run fixtures/appliances to check for active leaks; repair any leaking slip-joints or fittings
- Seal wall penetration (escutcheon and caulk/foam) to close gaps and deter pests
- Reconfigure auxiliary/dishwasher drain with required air gap or high loop to disposal/tailpiece per local code
- Clean and disinfect cabinet; dry thoroughly
- Repair/replace damaged cabinet panels and repaint/seal to protect substrate
- Consider a moisture alarm or pan under sink for early leak detection
