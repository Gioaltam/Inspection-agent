Location: Floor HVAC register (supply vent)

What I See: Bent/dented louvers on the metal grille; light rust present. Some dust/debris visible inside the register.

Issues to Address:
- Damaged/bent louvers on the register cover
- Minor corrosion on the grille

Recommended Action:
- Replace the register cover with a new unit of the same size; replace mounting screws if corroded.
- Vacuum and wipe the register box opening while the cover is off; check/replace the HVAC filter to limit dust buildup.
