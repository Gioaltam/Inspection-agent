Location: Floor vent/register

What I See:
- Metal grille with several bent louvers and light rust spots
- Noticeable dust/debris buildup inside the vent opening

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged register cover

Recommended Action:
- Replace the floor register cover with a same-size unit (measure the duct opening before purchase).
- While the cover is off, vacuum the duct opening and remove debris; consider a broader duct cleaning if buildup is widespread.
- If rust returns after replacement, check for moisture sources nearby.
