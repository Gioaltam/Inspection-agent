Location:
- Front exterior entry, steps, and driveway

Observations:
- Single-story brick veneer fa√ßade; asphalt-shingle roof; open eaves/no gutters visible
- Concrete stoop with three brick steps; metal storm/screen door
- Aluminum-framed windows; exterior floodlight over door
- Concrete driveway/walk abutting steps
- Loose exterior communication/cable line on right-side wall near window
- Bare/eroded soil area along foundation at right window

Potential Issues:
- Driveway/walk: visible cracks and surface wear; potential trip hazard
- Entry steps/stoop: mortar deterioration and open voids under/at sides; settlement gaps possible; pest entry points
- Entry steps lack handrail; fall hazard
- No gutters; roof runoff can cause splashback and foundation moisture
- Loose/unsecured exterior cable; lacks protection and may have unsealed wall penetrations
- Soil grade low/eroded near foundation; risk of water intrusion and foundation moisture
- Staining at lower brickwork suggests past moisture splashback

Recommendations:
- Seal and monitor driveway/walk cracks; grind/level if edges are raised
- Repoint/repair brick steps; fill voids; consider rebuilding if settlement confirmed
- Install a graspable handrail at steps
- Install gutters/downspouts with proper drainage away from foundation
- Secure and properly route exterior cabling; seal any wall penetrations
- Regrade/add soil to achieve positive slope away from foundation; add splash blocks or drains
- Clean brick and monitor for recurring moisture stains; address irrigation overspray if present
