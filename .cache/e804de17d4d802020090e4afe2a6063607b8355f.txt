Location:
- Exterior side yard near blue siding, by utilities and a large insulated stack.

Observations:
- Upright propane cylinder, rusty and stalled near the foundation.
- Gas shutoff valve and metal piping along siding show corrosion.
- Large round object on metal legs with thick insulation material stacked on top (unsecured).
- Ground area with bare soil, weeds, and scattered debris (bag, plastic bottle).
- No visible drip pan or containment for cylinder; area lacks clear ventilation.
- Exposed wiring/cord along the wall near the top.

Potential Issues:
- Corroded propane cylinder (rust around valve neck); risk of leakage or failure.
- Corroded gas piping; potential leaks and ignition risk.
- Cylinder stored directly on soil close to building and materials (tipping risk, moisture exposure).
- Insulation stack/materials stored near gas equipment; fire/motion hazard and moisture risk.
- Exposed electrical wiring without conduit; potential electrical hazard.
- General housekeeping issues creating trip/pest ingress and obstructed access.

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed propane/gas technician inspect and test for leaks; replace or remove severely corroded cylinder.
- Replace or repair corroded gas piping; ensure proper clearances and protective conduit as required.
- Move cylinder to a secure, ventilated area, off the ground, and with proper support/return to the supplier if needed.
- Maintain minimum clearance between gas equipment and flammable materials; remove/relocate insulation stack and debris.
- Correct electrical wiring: route in conduit, weatherproof outlet/connection; verify proper outdoor electrical safety.
- Clean area and remove clutter; treat ground surface to reduce moisture contact with metal components.
