Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (bathroom vanity)

Observations:
- Plastic tubular P-trap with slip-joint nuts
- Corrugated/accordion tailpiece used to connect sink to trap
- Wall drain stub-out at rear; rough opening around pipe
- Braided water supply lines and angle stop visible
- Items and an electrical cord stored on cabinet floor
- No obvious active leaks or water staining observed

Potential Issues:
- Corrugated/accordion tailpiece restricts flow and traps debris; often not code-compliant
- Multiple slip-joint connections increase leak points
- Gap/unfinished opening around wall drain stub-out; potential pest entry/odor path
- Electrical cord stored directly under plumbing; shock/fire risk if a leak occurs

Recommendations:
- Replace corrugated tailpiece with smooth-walled rigid tailpiece and proper fittings; align trap correctly
- Inspect/tighten slip-joint nuts and monitor for drips; replace worn washers as needed
- Seal wall penetration around drain (escutcheon/caulk/foam) to close gaps
- Remove/relocate electrical cord and nonessential items from under sink to reduce damage and safety risk
