Location:
- Bathroom sink base cabinet

Observations:
- White plastic P-trap to wall stub with slip-joint nuts
- Corrugated flexible tailpiece/extension from gray sink tailpiece to trap
- Braided water-supply lines/angle stop visible
- Cabinet base and fittings appear dry; no active drips noted

Potential Issues:
- Corrugated/accordion drain connector used as tailpiece; not code-approved in many areas, interior ridges trap debris and biofilm, restrict flow, and increase clog/odor/leak risk

Recommendations:
- Replace the flexible accordion tailpiece with a smooth, rigid tailpiece and proper slip-joint fittings; align trap with rigid offsets as needed
- Test run after replacement and check all joints for leaks
- Keep area under sink clear to allow early leak detection
