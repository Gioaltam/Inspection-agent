Location:
- Exterior window on a tan masonry/block wall, low to mid wall level. Aluminum jalousie style with interior blinds visible.

Observations:
- Horizontal louvers appear bent/damaged; left-lower area shows a missing/broken louver section.
- A pane/plate material sits on the window sill, suggesting a broken pane or removed panel.
- White concrete sill shows chipping/cracking; edge condition is rough.
- Window frame shows signs of corrosion/age; minimal to no visible exterior sealant at the perimeter.
- Surrounding wall paint shows wear near the sill.

Potential Issues:
- Missing/broken glass panel or damaged louver – security and weather intrusion risk.
- Likely water intrusion potential at sill perimeter due to missing/damaged glazing and lack of caulk/sealant.
- Corrosion on the metal frame – potential for frame failure or further system leakage.
- Perimeter gaps between window and masonry – air/water/pest entry risk.

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace the jalousie window (prefer a sealed unit or upgrade to a fixed/double-hung window).
- Recaulk perimeter around the window and repair the sill; ensure proper flashing and drainage.
- Treat corrosion on the frame and repaint or replace to prevent further deterioration.
- Clean and reseal or replace damaged louvers/panels; verify operability.
- Inspect interior for signs of moisture or mold and address if found.
