Location:
- Exterior window, red-painted sill at ground level

Observations:
- Aluminum slider window with screen; visible oxidation/soiling on frame
- Red painted masonry or concrete sill; scuffs, small chips/holes
- Flat white cable routed through gap under bottom window frame and over sill

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at bottom frame where cable passes; failed/missing sealant/caulk
- Improper wiring: exterior cable not in conduit/UV-rated jacket; mechanical damage risk
- Window weather seal likely compromised by cable; possible water intrusion path
- Pest entry point at unsealed penetration
- Substrate exposure from paint wear/chips on sill
- Trip hazard from loose cable along exterior wall/walk path

Recommendations:
- Remove/relocate cable; install properly rated exterior wiring in conduit with sealed wall penetration and drip loop
- Seal/caulk the frame-to-sill joint and any penetrations with exterior-grade sealant after cable relocation
- Clean frame; prep and repaint sill with exterior-grade coating; patch chips/holes
- Verify window closes/locks and weatherstrips seal after repairs
- Monitor/inspect interior below this window for any moisture; address if found
