Location:
- Exterior front elevation, large fixed window at lower pane/sill

Observations:
- Metal (likely aluminum) frame set above brick walkway
- Glass pane has star impact near lower center with multiple long cracks radiating
- Frame finish chipped at lower rail; dirt/debris in sill/track

Potential Issues:
- Cracked/broken glass pane; weakened, may shatter; sharp edges hazard
- Reduced weather seal; potential air/water intrusion at damaged glazing
- Exposed/chipped frame finish may oxidize/corrode over time
- No visible dents, bends, warping, gaps/separations, loose/missing fasteners, misalignment, failed caulk, rust, stains, mold, wiring issues, trip hazards, or pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged pane promptly; use code-compliant safety glass (tempered/laminated) to match
- After glazing, seal around pane and perimeter; verify weep holes clear
- Clean sill/track; repair/touch up frame finish to protect metal
- Consider full window replacement if unit is aged or seals are broadly failing
