Location:
- Under kitchen sink in cabinet.

Observations:
- White PVC waste piping with a P-trap and slip-joint compression fittings.
- Brown/orange staining at the top joint near the sink flange.
- Purple primer visible on a vertical riser (solvent-weld area).
- Cabinet clutter around the base.

Potential Issues:
- Possible active or past leak at the top compression joint (staining).
- Trap arrangement may form an S-trap/poor-vented path (potential siphon/odor risk).
- Aging fittings/joints; potential for further leaks.
- Limited accessibility due to clutter, hindering inspection/maintenance.

Recommendations:
- Inspect for leaks and reseal/replace stained joints as needed.
- Reconfigure to a proper P-trap with a horizontal trap arm to the wall drain (avoid S-trap). 
- Replace aged fittings if integrity is questionable; ensure correct gaskets and tight, clean joints.
- Clear clutter and test the drain with water to verify no leaks.
