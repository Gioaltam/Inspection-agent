Location:
- Interior frosted window (likely bathroom/utility), sliding sash.

Observations:
- Large spiderweb crack pattern centered toward the right side of the pane.
- Multiple radiating cracks and a curved segment; pane appears tempered/frosted.
- Frame/sill appear intact but with some dirt/staining on the sill.

Potential Issues:
- Cracked glass with radial cracks; safety hazard from potential shard release.
- Possible moisture intrusion risk at crack (water/condensation) and seal/ glazing integrity compromised.
- Minor sill staining suggesting past moisture exposure; not definitive but worth inspection.

Recommendations:
- Replace the cracked glass pane with a safety glass (tempered or laminated) and reseal the glazing beads.
- Inspect window frame and exterior flashing for water intrusion; reseal as needed.
- If immediate exposure risk, consider temporary covering or restricting access until replacement.
