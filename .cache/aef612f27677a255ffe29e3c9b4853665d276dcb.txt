Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet – garbage disposal and drain connections

Observations:
- Black garbage disposal mounted to sink flange
- Dishwasher drain hose (corrugated) connected to disposal inlet via yellow rubber coupler and worm‑drive clamp
- Disposal discharge tied to white PVC drain line
- Numerous stored items/cleaners in cabinet
- Electrical cords and a power strip visible at rear of cabinet

Potential Issues:
- Power strip/extension cord in damp under‑sink cabinet – shock/fire hazard
- Storage clutter crowds disposal and plumbing, obstructing access and risking damage

Recommendations:
- Remove power strip/extension cord; use a dedicated, grounded receptacle in an approved box (GFCI protection per local code)
- Clear/organize cabinet to maintain safe access and prevent contact with plumbing/electrical
- Confirm dishwasher drain has a proper high loop or air gap; install if missing
- Periodically check hose clamp and joints for leaks and resecure as needed
