Location:
- Interior ceiling, at wall-to-ceiling corner

Observations:
- Painted drywall/plaster ceiling with textured/skim-coated finish
- Central blister/bulge with multiple radial cracks
- Peeling/flaking paint and delaminating finish; loose edges
- No obvious discoloration visible in photo

Potential Issues:
- Cracks and separations in ceiling finish
- Peeling/failed paint and delamination; loose material may fall
- Localized bulging/warping of finish layer
- Evidence consistent with moisture damage; potential water intrusion from above
- Substrate exposure at cracks/openings

Recommendations:
- Identify and correct moisture source (roof/plumbing/HVAC/condensation) above this area
- Check with moisture meter; monitor for active dampness
- Remove all loose/delaminated material; dry thoroughly
- Repair/replace damaged drywall/plaster as needed; skim, prime (stain-blocking), repaint
- If a bathroom/kitchen above, improve ventilation and seal penetrations
- Reinspect after repairs to confirm no further movement or leaks
