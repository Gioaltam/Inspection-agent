Location:
- Front exterior, street view

Observations:
- Single-story house, asphalt-shingle gable roof
- Vinyl lap siding; metal-framed windows; storm door at entry
- Concrete driveway and public sidewalk; lawn with shrubs
- Large mature tree overhanging roof area
- No roof gutters/downspouts visible

Potential Issues:
- Roof staining/dark streaks visible — possible algae and granule wear
- Vinyl siding appears wavy/buckled in areas (left/front)
- Vegetation contacting siding/windows (left side) — moisture/pest bridge
- No gutters/downspouts observed — potential soil erosion/splashback at foundation
- Overhanging limbs above roof — potential impact/debris and pest access
- Sidewalk shows cracking/staining; possible uneven sections — trip hazard
- Isolated concrete pad/remnant in front yard — trip hazard

Recommendations:
- Licensed roofer to evaluate roof condition; clean and service; plan for replacement if wear confirmed
- Trim trees clear of roof and structure; maintain clearance
- Install gutters/downspouts with proper discharge away from foundation
- Refasten/adjust vinyl siding where buckled; verify proper nailing/expansion gaps
- Cut back/remove vegetation in contact with siding; maintain clearance
- Repair/relevel cracked/uneven sidewalk and remove/flush any stray concrete pads to eliminate trip hazards
- Clean exterior hard surfaces; inspect and seal window/door perimeters after closer review
