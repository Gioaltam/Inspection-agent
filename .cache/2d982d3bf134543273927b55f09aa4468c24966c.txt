Location:
- Front exterior, street/sidewalk view

Observations:
- One-story residence with asphalt-shingle gable roof
- Light-blue vinyl siding; slab-on-grade likely
- Concrete driveway and small front stoop; no dedicated walkway from sidewalk
- Aluminum/vinyl windows; metal security/storm door
- Large mature trees directly behind/overhanging roof
- Dense shrubs planted tight to front wall

Potential Issues:
- Roof shows dark streaking/biological growth; suggests aging and possible granule loss
- No front gutters/downspouts visible; roof runoff may splash siding and collect near foundation
- Vegetation contacting siding; moisture retention and pest harborage risk
- Tree limbs close to/over roof; abrasion/debris and storm-damage risk
- Sidewalk surface staining; could be slippery when wet
- Worn/bare lawn area near entry; potential muddy/slip condition in rain

Recommendations:
- Roofer to assess roof condition; clean algae and plan for maintenance/replacement as needed
- Install gutters/downspouts with extensions to discharge away from foundation
- Trim/clear shrubs 12â€“18 in from siding; maintain vegetation control for pest prevention
- Prune trees to provide safe clearance from roof; remove dead/damaged limbs
- Add a hard-surface walkway from drive/sidewalk to entry to reduce slip/mud
- Clean/treat sidewalk for algae/mildew; monitor and repair any developing cracks
