Location:
- Patio/sliding glass door opening (rear exterior wall), interior view.

Observations:
- Multiple glass panels appear not seated properly in the frame; some panels look stacked/loose inside the opening.
- Visible gaps near the vertical jamb; hardware/fasteners along the jamb are exposed.
- Interior curtain is draped over the opening; no obvious interior staining seen in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Misaligned/loose door panels; risk of panel failure or wind ingress.
- Gaps between sash and frame; possible air/water intrusion and energy loss.
- Missing or degraded exterior sealant/caulk around the perimeter.
- Possible frame/track wear or looseness not fully visible; potential safety hazard.

Recommendations:
- Have a qualified door installer realign/reseat panels; inspect and replace worn rollers and tracks.
- Re-seal exterior perimeter with weather-appropriate caulk; restore weatherstripping as needed.
- Inspect frame for rot, corrosion, or structural damage; address any fastener looseness.
- Verify proper operation and ensure no further gaps or obstructions.
