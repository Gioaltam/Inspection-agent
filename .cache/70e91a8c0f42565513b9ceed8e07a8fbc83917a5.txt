Location:
- Exterior ground-mounted A/C condenser (Goodman) next to house

Observations:
- Louvered metal housing with exposed condenser fins
- Organic debris caught in fins
- Several fins bent/flattened in spots
- Surface rust on top cover screws
- Vegetation growing up to unit; rock mulch at base
- Electrical whip and refrigerant lines visible at right

Potential Issues:
- Bent/flattened fins (dents/bends) restricting airflow
- Debris accumulation in coil causing partial blockage
- Corroded/rusted fasteners on top cover
- Vegetation contacting unit; reduced clearance and potential pest harborage

Recommendations:
- Clean condenser coil/fins; remove debris with gentle brushing/low‑pressure rinse
- Straighten fins with a fin comb where accessible
- Trim/clear vegetation; maintain ~12–24 in. side clearance and clear above
- Replace rusty screws and treat for corrosion
- Have HVAC technician service unit and verify performance after cleaning
