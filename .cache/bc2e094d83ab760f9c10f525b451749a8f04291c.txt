Location:
- Under-sink cabinet area with visible PVC drainage and a small beige/yellowish pipe.

Observations:
- White PVC drain with gray coupling/push-fit fitting.
- Brown/orange staining and mineral deposits along a vertical seam on the wall behind the drain.
- Gap/crack at the base of the cabinet wall with some substrate exposure.
- Screws/brackets visible; no obvious active drips in the photo.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected active or recent water intrusion at wall-floor seam (staining/deposits).
- Potential mold/mildew risk and wood/substrate rot behind cabinet due to moisture.
- Unsealed or deteriorating caulk/sealant around penetrations.
- Substrate exposure and possible deterioration of cabinet backing.
- Possible corrosion or deterioration of fasteners around the stained area.

Recommendations:
- Inspect for and repair any active leak at the drain/wall seam; perform a leak test on the trap and connections.
- Dry the area completely; clean and treat for any mold if present.
- Re-seal joints and penetrations with appropriate caulk/sealant; repair or replace damaged cabinet backer as needed.
- Secure or replace any corroded fasteners; ensure proper clamps/support for piping.
- Monitor area after rains or usage to ensure staining does not recur; if moisture persists, consult a plumber or general contractor to assess behind-wall condition.
