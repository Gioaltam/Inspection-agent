Location:
- Exterior side yard next to stucco wall with two windows and foundation vents

Observations:
- Stucco exterior wall; asphalt-shingle roof; open eaves
- Several foundation vents near grade
- Shrubs and landscaping close to wall
- PVC/irrigation riser or vacuum breaker near shrub
- Loose low‑voltage cable/wire draped from soffit area
- Lawn shows patchy/uneven grass; small debris on ground
- No gutters/downspouts visible on this eave

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact/very close to siding—moisture/pest pathway
- Unsecured exterior cable/wire—improper support/exposure
- No gutters/downspouts—roof runoff may cause splashback/erosion at foundation
- Stucco/sill line close to grade—reduced clearance can promote moisture/pest entry
- Exposed irrigation riser could be a mowing/trip impact hazard
- Yard debris present

Recommendations:
- Trim/maintain vegetation 12–18 in away from walls; keep soil/mulch below weep/vent level
- Secure or reroute exterior cable per manufacturer/electrical standards; use proper clamps/conduit as needed
- Consider installing gutters with downspout extensions to discharge 4–6 ft from foundation; maintain positive grading
- Verify foundation vent screens are intact; maintain adequate clearance to grade
- Add protection or relocate irrigation riser to reduce damage/trip risk
- Remove debris; maintain lawn/ground cover to reduce erosion and pests
