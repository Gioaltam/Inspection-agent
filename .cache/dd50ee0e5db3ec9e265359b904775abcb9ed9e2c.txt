- Floor type: Woodâ€‘look laminate or luxury vinyl plank (LVP), floating installation. Location: center seam visible in image.

- Notable issue: Separated/seam crack between two planks with dark gap along the joint.

- Condition: No visible cupping or water staining around the seam in this photo.

- Possible cause: Subfloor movement or improper acclimation/expansion due to moisture.

- Recommendations: Check subfloor moisture and underlayment, assess for continued separation, consider re-seating or replacing affected planks, verify proper expansion gaps around perimeter.
