Location:
- Under kitchen sink, in the cabinet.

Observations:
- Chrome vertical waste tailpiece connected to a white PVC P-trap.
- Visible mineral buildup/soil around joints; discolored trap area.
- Two supply lines with shutoffs visible at the back.
- Cabinet floor shows staining; possible past moisture exposure.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected leak at slip-joint connections (mineral buildup and staining).
- Aging/discolored trap (possible crack or joint wear).
- Corrosion/dirt on nuts and joints; potential future leak risk.
- Possible hidden moisture/mold risk behind cabinet due to staining.

Recommendations:
- Perform a leak test; tighten/replace slip-joint nuts and washers as needed.
- Replace the white trap with a new trap (properly rated PVC/CPVC or brass) and ensure correct trap arm slope and seal.
- Inspect/replace aging supply lines if corrosion is evident; ensure shutoffs seal well.
- Clean and dry cabinet area; remedy any active moisture; reseal bottom of cabinet and check for mold.
