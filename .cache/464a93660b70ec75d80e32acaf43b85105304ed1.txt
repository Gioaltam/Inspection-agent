Location:
- Under kitchen sink – drain and trap assembly inside base cabinet

Observations:
- White plastic slip‑joint P‑trap with double‑bowl tailpiece tee
- Metal sink strainer/locknut at top connection
- Heavy mineral/soap buildup and discoloration on trap and slip‑joint nuts
- Cluttered storage below; open container with standing water present
- Flexible tube/cord lying in cabinet

Potential Issues:
- Evidence of leaks: mineral deposits and water staining at multiple slip‑joint fittings and trap bend
- Corrosion at metal strainer/connection
- Standing water in container indicates active/recent drip; moisture source for mold/rot
- Crowded storage contacting piping—risk of loosening joints and obstructed access (unsafe condition)

Recommendations:
- Run water and inspect all joints; repair leaks; replace slip‑joint washers and consider replacing entire trap/tailpiece assembly
- Clean/remove mineral buildup; dry area to confirm if new leaks appear
- Inspect and reseal/replace corroded sink strainer and gasket/putty
- Clear stored items from around piping; keep cabinet dry; add drip tray or moisture alarm
- If moisture damage is found, dry and remediate/repair cabinet and check for mold
