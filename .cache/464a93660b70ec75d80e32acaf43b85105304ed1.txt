Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (kitchen) – drain/trap assembly

Observations:
- White plastic tubular drain with slip-joint nuts; P-trap to black ABS drain line at rear/right
- Vertical tailpiece with side tee/continuous waste to adjacent sink bowl (left)
- Heavy mineral/grime buildup on multiple fittings
- Cabinet crowded with stored items; containers with water present

Potential Issues:
- Evidence of leakage at several slip-joint connections (staining/mineral deposits)
- Possible active moisture under sink (standing water in containers) – risk of mold/mildew and cabinet damage
- Access obstructed by stored items, limiting inspection and creating unsafe/blocked conditions

Recommendations:
- Run water and check each joint; tighten or replace slip-joint washers/fittings as needed; replace trap assembly if leaks persist
- Clean and dry cabinet surfaces; discard water, monitor for new moisture
- Reduce/organize storage to maintain clear access to plumbing and to spot leaks early
- If leaks continue or assembly is deteriorated, have a licensed plumber evaluate and repair/replace components
