- Flooring: wood-look laminate or LVP; interior main living area.  
- Notable defect: localized dark brown patch with irregular, jagged edges on a single plank.  
- Possible causes: surface stain or finish damage; potential moisture intrusion or delamination underneath.  
- Condition: surrounding plank appears normal; no visible cupping or swelling in photo.  
- Recommendation: inspect underlayment/subfloor moisture; check adjacent planks for similar patches; replace damaged plank if delamination is confirmed; use manufacturer-approved cleaner if it's a surface stain only.
