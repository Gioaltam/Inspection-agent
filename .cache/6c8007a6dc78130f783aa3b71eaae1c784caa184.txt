Location:
- Exterior wood siding at the eave/roofline (bottom edge of siding above the gutter/fascia).

Observations:
- Paint severely peeling and blistered.
- Boards show heavy surface rot/softened areas and cracking.
- Black tar-like material/sealant at the base near the fascia.
- Gaps/voids between boards; some nails exposed.
- Trim/edge appears degraded; possible moisture intrusion pathway.

Potential Issues:
- Severe wood rot and potential structural decay.
- Water intrusion risk into wall cavity/attic.
- Missing/failed sealant and flashing increases leak potential.
- Possible pest entry points (insect damage) and mold risk.
- Loose or degraded fasteners; misalignment of siding at the edge.

Recommendations:
- Replace severely rotted siding sections or entire affected panel; treat underlying wood as needed.
- Remove old sealant, re-flash and reseal joints with exterior-grade caulk; install proper flashing.
- Prime, seal, and repaint repaired areas; ensure a durable weather barrier.
- Inspect roof edge/gutters for drainage, repair as needed to prevent future water intrusion.
- Have a carpenter/roofer inspect for hidden rot behind siding and assess need for venting/insulation improvement.
- If there is any suspicion of pests (termite/borers), arrange a professional inspection.
