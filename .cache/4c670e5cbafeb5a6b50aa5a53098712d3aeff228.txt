Location: Wall/ceiling vent register (HVAC)

What I See:
- Dust/debris buildup on grille
- Several louvers are bent with light surface rust; damper lever looks slightly bent

Issues to Address:
- Bent louvers and minor corrosion that may restrict airflow/operation

Recommended Action:
- Remove grille and clean thoroughly; vacuum duct opening
- If damper sticks or airflow is restricted, replace the register
- If keeping it, straighten fins, remove rust, and repaint with rust-inhibiting primer/paint
- Ensure mounting screws are snug and the damper operates smoothly
