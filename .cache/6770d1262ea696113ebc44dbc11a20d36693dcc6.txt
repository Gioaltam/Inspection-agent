Location:
- Under-sink cabinet, back wall/plumbing penetrations

Observations:
- PVC drain piping with slip coupling; CPVC/PEX supply lines; braided flex connector
- White mineral deposits and brown staining on back panel below supply connection
- Staining and swelling/delamination at cabinet base near drain supports
- Hairline cracks in cabinet panel; unsealed gaps around pipe penetrations
- Pipe straps/screws present; no obvious active drip visible in photo

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leak evidence at supply/penetration (stains/mineral deposits)
- Panel damage: swelling/warping, cracks, and delamination of substrate
- Possible surface mold/mildew on stained areas
- Failed/missing sealant at penetrations; gaps may allow pest entry

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber identify and repair any active leaks at supply fittings/valve and drain connections
- Dry area thoroughly; clean/disinfect for mildew; replace damaged cabinet panel/liner if softened or mold-affected
- Seal/caulk around all pipe penetrations; add escutcheons as needed to close gaps
- Monitor after repair; consider a leak detector/alarm under the sink
