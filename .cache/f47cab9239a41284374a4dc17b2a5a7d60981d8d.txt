Location:
- Ground-floor balcony window screen corner view.

Observations:
- Screen mesh intact but bottom edge appears loose/sagging.
- Bottom track shows dirt, paint wear, and possible minor corrosion.
- Small gap between frame and sill; sealant appears aged with minor cracking.
- No obvious water stains or mold visible from this angle.

Potential Issues:
- Torn/loose screen at lower portion (pest entry risk).
- Gap between screen/frame and bottom track (water/air intrusion risk).
- Corrosion/wear on metal track (potential future failure).
- Dried/ cracked sealant along sill joint (water intrusion path).

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace the lower screen panel; reseat/spline as needed.
- Clean track; reseal exterior joint with exterior-grade caulk/sealant.
- Inspect and address any corrosion; repaint or replace affected track if needed.
- Monitor for moisture or mold; treat if detected. Tighten any loose fasteners in the corner.
