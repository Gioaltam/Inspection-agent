Location:
- Exterior side yard; RUUD outdoor AC condenser next to stucco wall and window

Observations:
- Metal condenser on concrete pad; side intake grille shown
- Electrical disconnect mounted on wall nearby; conduits present
- Vegetation/grass encroaching around base and sides
- Stucco wall shows visible vertical and meandering cracks behind unit
- Top cover shows light surface scuffs/scratches

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting condenser; potential airflow restriction and coil blockage
- Clearance to wall appears limited (<12 in); may restrict airflow and service access
- Stucco wall cracks present; potential water intrusion and pest entry at exterior

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove vegetation; keep at least 24 in clearance around unit and 60 in above
- Verify manufacturer-required wall clearance; adjust/relocate unit if inadequate
- Clean condenser coils and clear debris at base
- Repair and seal stucco cracks; prime/paint to protect exterior
- Schedule routine HVAC service after clearing to confirm proper operation
