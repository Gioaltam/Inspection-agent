Location:
- Roof edge/valley area of an asphalt shingle roof above the exterior wall fascia.

Observations:
- Several shingles at the edge are cracked, torn, or displaced.
- Shingle granules worn; underlayment/roof deck appears exposed in scored area.
- Tan sealant/strapping along the edge is torn and not sealing.
- Debris (leaves) accumulated in the lower edge/deck area.
- Fascia/soffit area shows exposed wood and possible edge deterioration; gutter/drip edge not clearly present or is damaged.

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion risk from missing/damaged shingles and exposed underlayment.
- Possible wood rot or deterioration in fascia/soffit behind damaged edge.
- Debris accumulation could clog drainage and encourage pests.
- Improper or failed sealant flashing at roof edge.

Recommendations:
- Replace/dereg damaged edge shingles and reinstall proper flashing.
- Repair or replace fascia/soffit as needed; ensure drip edge and gutter are secure and sealing.
- Clean debris from edge and inspect drainage path; ensure proper venting and water shedding.
- Have a roofer verify no hidden rot and reseal with appropriate flashing/caulk where required.
