Location:
- Exterior of a single-car garage, side/front with white roll-up door; overhang above.

Observations:
- White stucco walls; trim near door shows wear/peeling paint.
- Gap/misalignment at door jamb/top frame; weather seal appears missing or degraded.
- Debris pile in front of door: broken pallets/wood pieces and cardboard.
- Black flexible conduit or hose attached to wall near left of door; appears unsecured.
- Ground surface dry with sparse grass; concrete slab in front of door.

Potential Issues:
- Gaps around door frame and degraded sealant could cause water/air intrusion.
- Debris and exposed wood near entry present trip hazard and pest/rot risk.
- Unsecured conduit/ hose could be an electrical or moisture hazard if not properly protected.
- Possible misalignment of door could affect operation and seal.

Recommendations:
- Remove debris; store or dispose of wood pieces away from doorway.
- Re-seal/caulk around garage door perimeter; verify door is plumb and adjust if needed; replace weather-stripping.
- Inspect for wood rot or insect damage near jamb; repair/replace affected framing as needed.
- Secure or properly shield conduit/hose; ensure electrical components are weatherproof and up to code.
- Ensure proper drainage away from foundation and extend downspouts if necessary.
