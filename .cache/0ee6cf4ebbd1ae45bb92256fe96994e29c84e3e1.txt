Location:
- Under kitchen sink; garbage disposal, dishwasher drain, PVC trap

Observations:
- Black disposal unit mounted to sink flange
- Gray corrugated dishwasher hose to disposal with hose clamp
- Disposal outlet to white PVC trap and branch drain
- Heavy mineral deposits/corrosion at sink flange/mounting ring
- Plastic catch pan below with standing dirty water
- Power cord draped low near/into the water

Potential Issues:
- Active/ongoing leak indicated by standing water in pan
- Corrosion and mineral buildup at sink flange/mount; likely failed sealant/putty
- Water intrusion/stains under sink; conducive to damage and odors
- Electrical shock hazard: disposal power cord in contact with standing water
- Possible microbial growth in pan from prolonged moisture

Recommendations:
- Plumber to repair/replace and properly seal sink flange/mount; replace corroded hardware as needed
- Leak test all connections (disposal body, dishwasher inlet, discharge, trap)
- Remove standing water; clean/sanitize and thoroughly dry cabinet; monitor for recurrence
- Elevate/secure disposal power cord; ensure outlet is GFCI-protected; replace cord if damaged
- Consider leak detector/pan to alert of future leaks
