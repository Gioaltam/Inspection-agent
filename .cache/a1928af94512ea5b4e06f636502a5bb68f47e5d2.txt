Location:
- Exterior concrete entry stoop/landing at the door threshold.

Observations:
- Gray painted concrete surface with several large spalls exposing aggregate.
- Numerous cracks across the surface, including hairline and wider separations.
- Edges show chipping; surface appears weathered with dirt and paint remnants.
- No visible standing water in photo; door/window framing above shows minor peeling.

Potential Issues:
- Spalling and cracks indicate concrete deterioration; potential for water intrusion through patches/cracks.
- Freezeâ€“thaw risk may worsen with moisture in cracks; potential trip hazard from uneven surface.
- Possible moisture intrusion around door threshold if flashing/sealant compromised.

Recommendations:
- Patch spalls with exterior concrete repair material; fill and smooth all cracks.
- Recoat/ resurfacer as needed and seal entire surface; apply water-repellent exterior sealer.
- Inspect and reseal door threshold area and flashing; re-caulk joints around the door/adjacent openings.
- Ensure slope away from the door for proper drainage; monitor for any new movement and consult structural/flatwork if cracking progresses.
