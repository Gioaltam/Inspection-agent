Location:
- Exterior side elevation, stucco wall, first-floor window and sill

Observations:
- Stucco exterior finish; painted masonry/concrete sill
- Aluminum single-hung window with insect screen
- Perimeter caulk/painted sealant present around frame
- Screen frame appears bowed/loose; spline not fully seated
- Minor paint chipping at sill edge

Potential Issues:
- Hairline stucco cracks near/around window
- Failed/missing/irregular sealant at window perimeter and sill joints; small gaps visible
- Loose/misaligned insect screen; bent frame
- Paint chipping with limited substrate exposure at sill
- Potential water intrusion at cracks and unsealed joints
- Possible pest entry when window opened due to loose screen

Recommendations:
- Clean and re-caulk all window-to-stucco joints with exterior-grade sealant; ensure continuous bead
- Fill hairline stucco cracks with elastomeric patch; repaint as needed
- Repair/replace insect screen and reseat spline; straighten/replace bent frame
- Prep, prime, and repaint sill to seal exposed areas; maintain slope for drainage
- Verify window weep holes are open (not painted shut); monitor interior for any signs of moisture stains
