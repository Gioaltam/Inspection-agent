Location: Sloped ceiling by window

What I See:
- Unfinished drywall patch on the sloped ceiling
- Torn/delaminated drywall paper and open seams at the edge of the patch

Issues to Address:
- Incomplete/damaged drywall finish (exposed fasteners, gaps, torn paper)

Recommended Action:
- Have a drywall contractor rework the patch: remove loose material, properly secure to framing, tape/bed joints, skim/texture to match, then prime and paint.
- Before closing, check the area for any moisture with a meter and inspect exterior roof/wall flashing in this section; correct any source of water intrusion if found.
