Location: Sloped ceiling near window (upper room)

What I See:
- Large drywall patch panel on the sloped ceiling
- Edges torn and not taped/mudded; several exposed screws and gaps at seams

Issues to Address:
- Damaged/loose drywall at patch corner with separation from existing ceiling
- Unfinished drywall (exposed paper and fasteners)

Recommended Action:
- Have a drywall contractor re-secure the panel to framing or replace the damaged section
- Tape and mud all seams, set/cover fasteners, sand, prime, and paint to match
- If this patch was from a prior leak, verify no active moisture before closing up (moisture check/roof review)
