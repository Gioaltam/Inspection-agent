- Location: Ceiling vent/grille (likely supply or return) with white painted metal frame and vertical louvers.
- Condition: Dust buildup on louvers; interior behind grill appears dark with rust discoloration.
- Attachment: Frame secured by two screws; no obvious warping or gaps.
- Concern: Rust/oxide behind vent suggests possible humidity/moisture intrusion affecting ductwork.
- Recommendation: Clean the vent; inspect duct for moisture leaks or corrosion; replace grille if corrosion progresses.
