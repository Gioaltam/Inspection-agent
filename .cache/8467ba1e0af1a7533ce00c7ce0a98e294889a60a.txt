Location:
- Left side yard/exterior wall and eave

Observations:
- Vinyl siding with vented vinyl soffit and metal/aluminum fascia; no gutter on this eave
- Plastic storage cabinet tight to wall; assorted items stored along wall (tire, bins, tools, blue drum, cart)
- Overhead utility line spans yard
- Vegetation/weeds growing against wall and around stored items
- Metal/plastic utility cart present; visible surface rust on metal shelf/frame

Potential Issues:
- Soffit panel near eave appears loose/misaligned with a gap at the edge (possible pest/moisture entry)
- No gutter present on this roof edgeâ€”rain runoff likely to splash at siding/foundation
- Vegetation and debris in contact with siding; conducive to moisture retention and pests
- Stored items tight to structure block inspection/maintenance; trip and tip hazards present
- Rust/corrosion on metal cart; potential for sharp edges/injury

Recommendations:
- Re-secure/repair misaligned soffit; seal any gaps; screen as needed to prevent pest entry
- Consider installing gutters/downspouts and direct discharge away from foundation
- Remove/relocate stored items away from siding; maintain clear working path
- Cut back vegetation and keep a vegetation-free band around the foundation
- Dispose of or repair rusted cart; manage site clutter to reduce hazards
- Maintain safe clearance under overhead utility lines; avoid storing tall equipment beneath them
