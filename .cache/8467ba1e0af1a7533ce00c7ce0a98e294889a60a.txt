Location:
- Exterior side yard by house eave and adjacent storage shed

Observations:
- House with vinyl lap siding; vented soffit/fascia at eave; no gutter visible
- Misc. stored items against wall (tire, bins, tools, cart, blue drum)
- Tall grass/weeds around foundation area
- Overhead utility lines in background

Potential Issues:
- Soffit panel at eave appears loose/misaligned with gaps/voids; potential pest entry and moisture intrusion
- Vegetation and stored debris against siding; pest harborage and moisture retention
- Trip/fall hazards from cluttered walkway and scattered items
- Tires and containers may hold standing water (mosquito breeding)
- Surface rust on metal items; minor injury/staining potential
- Possible lack of gutters may cause splashback/erosion at foundation (not confirmed)

Recommendations:
- Re-secure/repair soffit panels; close gaps and check for damage at eave/attic edge
- Clear vegetation 6â€“12 in from siding; remove debris and organize storage away from structure
- Drain/cover or remove tires/containers to prevent standing water
- Consider installing gutters/downspouts to manage roof runoff
- Maintain clear, safe access path; remove trip hazards
- Trim trees away from lines and house; consult utility for clearance near overhead wires
