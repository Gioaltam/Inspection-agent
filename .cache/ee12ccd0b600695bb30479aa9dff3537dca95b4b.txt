Location: Ceiling fan/light fixture

What I See:
- Noticeable dust buildup along blade edges and housing
- Fixture and blades appear intact; no visible damage

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed

Recommended Action:
- Perform routine cleaning of blades and housing to reduce dust and keep the fan balanced
- Remove the protective film/sticker from the light globe if still present
- While cleaning, check and snug blade screws and mounting hardware to prevent wobble
