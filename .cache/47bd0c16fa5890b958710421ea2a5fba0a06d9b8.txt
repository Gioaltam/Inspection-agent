Location:
- Front yard area between the white and red houses; cracked concrete walkway and stepping-paths.

Observations:
- Concrete walk/slab is cracked and broken, with visible separation.
- Grass and weeds growing through joints and encroaching onto walkways.
- Stepping stones to the red house appear uneven and misaligned.
- White house has a railing/ramp setup at the entrance; exterior siding looks aged.
- No visible water staining or mold on exterior surfaces from this view.

Potential Issues:
- Trip hazard from cracked/uneven concrete slabs.
- Possible water intrusion risk where cracks are present and slabs are disturbed.
- Vegetation touching or close to foundations could retain moisture or invite pests.
- Uneven stepping-paths may affect safe ingress/egress.

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace cracked concrete; ensure slabs are level and properly anchored.
- Trim/remove overgrown grass and weeds; reseal joints as needed.
- Re-grade or improve drainage away from foundations; extend downspouts if needed.
- Maintain clearance between vegetation and building envelopes; evaluator to verify accessibility path safety (handrails, non-slip surface).
