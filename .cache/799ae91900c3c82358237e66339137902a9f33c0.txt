Location:
- Under kitchen sink; garbage disposal (InSinkErator Badger 5) mounted to sink drain. White PVC P-trap present. Cleaning bottles/cans stored in cabinet.

Observations:
- Disposal unit appears properly mounted with flange and mounting ring.
- P-trap connects to disposal outlet and to wall drain; alignment looks modestly off at the trap/disposal junction.
- Dishwasher drain hose not clearly visible; no air gap seen in photo.
- Electrical connection for the disposal not visible in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Possible loose/misaligned connection between disposal discharge and P-trap (could leak).
- No visible sealant around sink flange area (potential leak area if not properly sealed).
- Dishwasher drain hookup not evident; ensure knockout plug removed if dishwasher is connected, and that an air gap/setup is correct.
- Electrical wiring for disposal not visible; verify proper wiring, strain relief, and GFCI protection if required.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and tighten/repair the disposal-to-trap connection; reseal as needed to prevent leaks.
- Confirm proper sealant around the sink drain flange.
- Verify dishwasher drain hookup (or cap if none) and install an air gap if required by code.
- Inspect electrical wiring for the disposal; ensure it is properly wired, protected, and on a grounded/GFCI-protected circuit.
