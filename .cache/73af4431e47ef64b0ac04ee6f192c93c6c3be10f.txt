Location:
- Interior laminate wood floor; isolated patch in the central area of the visible floor.

Observations:
- Irregular brown patch with rough, jagged edges about 2â€“3 inches long.
- Surrounding laminate appears intact; no visible stains or water trails beyond the patch.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected delamination or damage to the wear layer/subfloor under the patch.
- Possible moisture intrusion or previous spill leading to patch formation.
- Potential trip/hazard if the patch is raised or rough.

Recommendations:
- Inspect moisture source and subfloor beneath the patch (may require lifting the plank).
- Replace the damaged plank or repair/patch as needed; ensure proper underlayment and seam sealing.
- Reassess flooring for uniformity after repair; consider professional flooring contractor if unsure.
