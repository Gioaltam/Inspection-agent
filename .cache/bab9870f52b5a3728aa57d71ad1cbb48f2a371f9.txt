Location:
- Left side yard along exterior wall, near chain‑link fence and large tree

Observations:
- Stucco exterior wall with small low window; concrete steps at front left
- Chain‑link fence with top rail; wood privacy fence at rear
- Overhead utility lines above yard and through tree canopy
- Exposed exterior piping/lines on wall; one with valve
- Patchy/uneven lawn; tall overgrown ornamental grass by fence

Potential Issues:
- Overgrown vegetation narrowing access and contacting/near fence; potential pest harborage
- Uneven/settled lawn areas creating trip hazard
- Overhead utility lines routed through/near tree branches (clearance/safety concern)
- Exterior finish very close to grade; risk of moisture wicking/splashback to stucco
- Exposed wall piping vulnerable to impact/UV; insulation on line appears weathered
- Chain‑link fence section appears slightly leaning/bent at top rail

Recommendations:
- Trim/clear vegetation from fence and structure; maintain clearance
- Have utility company/qualified arborist evaluate and prune trees away from overhead lines
- Regrade/level and re‑sod bare areas; ensure slope away from foundation
- Maintain 6+ inches clearance from soil to stucco; add gravel strip or adjust grade as needed
- Protect exterior piping with guards/conduit; replace degraded insulation; label/secure valve
- Repair/straighten fence post/top rail and secure as needed
