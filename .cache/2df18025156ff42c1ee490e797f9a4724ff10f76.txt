Location:
- Kitchen, wall area directly behind the electric coil stove/ countertop.

Observations:
- Wall shows heavy paint peeling/flaking with white patches near the lower section.
- Surface appears damp or efflorescent; no backsplash present.
- Countertop edge visible; a bottle sits on the back of the stove.

Potential Issues:
- Moisture intrusion indicated by peeling paint and staining; substrate exposure behind wall.
- Possible mold risk behind the damaged wall surface.
- Lack of backsplash/ sealed finish increases risk of further moisture damage and staining.
- Gaps/caulk at the wall-to-counter seam not clearly visible but potential.

Recommendations:
- Investigate and address moisture source (leak, humidity, or condensation); dry and dehumidify the area.
- Remove loose material; repair or replace damaged drywall/board.
- Apply moisture-resistant primer and paint, or install a proper heat-resistant backsplash (tile, plastic laminate, or stainless/ceramic panel).
- Re-seal the wall-to-counter seam and ensure clean, continuous sealant where applicable.
- If mold is suspected or found, perform proper remediation; improve kitchen ventilation (range hood) to reduce future moisture.
- Consider a periodic reinspection after repairs to confirm no recurrence.
