- Location: Exterior wall at grade level, near brick veneer; moisture staining along foundation.
- Materials: White PVC condensate/drain piping, stucco wall with peeling paint, soil with moss/weeds at base.
- Condition: Pipe penetrations show staining and moss; wall surface cracked/peeling around penetration; vegetation contacting foundation.
- Potential issues: Moisture intrusion risk from unsealed wall penetrations; vegetation and soil against wall may promote pests and further moisture damage.
- Recommendations: Seal/opening with exterior sealant or foam; remove vegetation and improve grading away from wall; repair stucco/paint; inspect pipe for leaks and secure to wall.
