Location: Interior floor (laminate/vinyl plank)

What I See:
- Open seams with visible gaps and slight height mismatch between planks.
- Edge chipping/fraying along the joint; debris in the seam.

Issues to Address:
- Plank separation and lippage at joints.
- Chipped/damaged plank edges; possible swelling at seams.

Recommended Action:
- Check area for moisture intrusion (use a moisture meter; inspect nearby plumbing/doors). Address any source before repairs.
- If dry, have a flooring installer re-seat or replace the affected planks and clean out debris; verify proper expansion gaps and subfloor flatness to prevent peaking.
- If moisture is present or edges are swollen, dry the area thoroughly and replace damaged planks.
