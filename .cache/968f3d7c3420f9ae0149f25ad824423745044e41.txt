Location: Interior flooring (laminate/LVP)

What I See:
- Open gaps and misaligned end joints between planks.
- Edge lifting with minor chipping/fray along the seams.

Issues to Address:
- Loose/lifted planks creating gaps and a small trip/snag hazard.
- Edge damage at the joint; possible swelling from moisture or an uneven subfloor.

Recommended Action:
- Remove and re-seat the affected row(s) to lock joints tight; replace any planks with damaged locking tabs or swollen edges.
- Clean debris from joints; use colorâ€‘matched seam filler only for hairline gaps after repair.
- Check for moisture sources (spills, appliance leaks) and verify adequate expansion gaps and subfloor flatness before reinstallation. If multiple areas show the same issue, consider relaying the floor.
