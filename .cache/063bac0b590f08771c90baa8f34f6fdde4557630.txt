Location:
- Bathroom ceiling, near the shower (exhaust vent/vent grille).

Observations:
- Rectangular metal exhaust vent with noticeable rust on grille and surrounding edges.
- Rust staining appears concentrated around the vent; pull-chain hanging from vent.
- Popcorn ceiling texture; shower head and tile area visible below.

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust on vent cover indicating moisture exposure.
- Possible concealed moisture damage or mold behind vent due to ongoing humidity.
- Potential gaps/sealant deterioration around vent allowing air/moisture intrusion.

Recommendations:
- Replace rusted vent cover and inspect/servicing of the exhaust fan; ensure proper operation.
- Inspect attic/behind ceiling for water damage or mold; repair any damage and treat if needed.
- Re-seal around vent with appropriate non-corrosive sealant; consider upgrading to a more corrosion-resistant/higher-capacity fan if humidity is high.
- Clean/replace vent components as needed and verify exterior vent termination is clear of obstructions.
