Location:
- Exterior, ground-mounted HVAC condenser (Ameristar)

Observations:
- Louvered metal cabinet with exposed condenser fins
- Brand badge scuffed; cabinet paint intact
- Panels/fasteners present; no visible rust
- Light dust on fins
- Vegetation present near base corner

Potential Issues:
- Bent/flattened condenser fins in several areas (airflow/efficiency impact)
- Vegetation encroachment at base (airflow restriction, pest harborage)

Recommendations:
- Carefully straighten fins with a fin comb; avoid coil damage
- Clean condenser coil with low-pressure water/HVAC-safe cleaner
- Maintain 12â€“24 in. clearance around all sides; trim vegetation
- Include unit in routine HVAC service for performance check
