Location:
- Exterior condenser unit (Ameristar), likely at side yard

Observations:
- Louvered metal cabinet with aluminum coil fins behind grille
- Finish appears intact; label scuffed
- Light dust/debris on coil surface
- Minor localized fin bending visible

Potential Issues:
- Bent/damaged condenser fins may restrict airflow
- Coil surface dirty, could reduce heat exchange
- Vegetation noted near base could impede airflow if allowed to grow
- No visible corrosion, cracks, gaps, loose/missing fasteners, wiring issues, or water stains

Recommendations:
- Clean condenser coil with low-pressure water/appropriate cleaner
- Gently straighten fins with a fin comb
- Maintain 18â€“24 in. clearance from vegetation on all sides
- Monitor cabinet for rust and keep unit level on a stable pad
- Have HVAC technician service if performance/noise issues are noted
