Location:
- Ceiling-mounted circular exhaust/vent fan fixture (likely bathroom or utility area).

Observations:
- 7-blade plastic blower wheel; central yellow cap; gray outer ring.
- Substantial dust/dirt on blade faces and interior; no visible grille/cover in place.
- Ceiling surface around fixture appears intact; no water stains or mold visible.

Potential Issues:
- Exposed moving blades due to missing/absent protective grille – safety hazard.
- Heavy dust buildup on blades/housing – potential fire risk, reduced performance, possible mold growth behind unit.
- Possible blade wear/chipping affecting balance and causing noise/vibration.
- Unknown electrical condition (wiring not fully visible); potential safety concern if cover is missing.

Recommendations:
- Install a proper grille/cover or replace the fixture to restore safety.
- Thoroughly clean the interior and blades; inspect for mold or moisture intrusion.
- Inspect blades for damage; replace blower wheel or entire unit if blades are chipped or imbalanced.
- Have an electrician/ HVAC technician verify wiring connections and test operation; confirm vent path to exterior is clear.
