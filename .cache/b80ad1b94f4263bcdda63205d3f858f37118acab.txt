Location:
- Exterior wall at utility/HVAC area near grade and brick veneer

Observations:
- White PVC drain line with 90° elbow exiting stucco
- Visible algae/mineral staining on pipe; active drip marks
- Gap around wall penetration; missing/failed sealant; stucco/paint peeling
- Wet/mossy soil at base; small standing water
- Short PVC piece on ground appears disconnected/abandoned
- Exposed low‑voltage cable on wall without conduit
- Vegetation and roots against foundation; uneven stepping stone

Potential Issues:
- Water discharge at foundation causing moisture accumulation and potential wall/foundation saturation
- Gaps/voids and cracks at penetration; failed/missing caulk; pest entry path; water intrusion risk
- Stucco/paint deterioration with substrate exposure
- Organic growth (algae/moss) indicates persistent moisture; conducive to mold/rot
- Unprotected/exposed wiring vulnerable to damage (improper/no conduit)
- Trip/fall hazard from uneven stone and exposed roots
- Unidentified/loose PVC component on ground may be a damaged/abandoned drain part

Recommendations:
- Seal around pipe with exterior‑grade flexible sealant; add escutcheon; repair stucco and repaint
- Extend or reroute condensate/drain termination to discharge away from foundation to an approved drain/splash block; maintain proper slope and air gap
- Improve grading/drainage; remove standing water; clear moss and vegetation from foundation area
- Have HVAC/plumbing tech evaluate the loose PVC; remove or properly reconnect/terminate
- Inspect lower wall for moisture damage and repair as needed
- Protect exposed cable in UV‑rated conduit and secure per code
- Level/secure walking surface and remove roots/debris to reduce trip hazards
