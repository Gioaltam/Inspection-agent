Location:
- Exterior; outdoor A/C condenser (Comfortmaker)

Observations:
- Metal grille over aluminum condenser fins
- Fins heavily soiled with lint/dirt; dark/plugged areas
- Multiple areas of bent/flattened fins
- Vegetation/weeds contacting cabinet and lower coil
- Manufacturer label worn; grille appears intact

Potential Issues:
- Airflow restriction from dirt/debris on fins → reduced cooling/overheating risk
- Bent/flattened fins further restrict heat exchange
- Vegetation contact blocks airflow and can trap moisture/pests
- Possible efficiency loss and increased compressor strain

Recommendations:
- Clear vegetation around unit; maintain ~2–3 ft side and 4–5 ft top clearance
- Professionally clean condenser coil (non-corrosive cleaner; rinse from inside out)
- Comb/straighten fins where possible; replace damaged coil sections if not restorable
- Have HVAC technician service the unit post-cleaning to verify operation/pressures and efficiency
