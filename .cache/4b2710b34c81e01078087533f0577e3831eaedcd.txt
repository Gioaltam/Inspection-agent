Location:
- Exterior condenser unit (Comfortmaker), ground level next to vegetation

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with wire coil guard; aluminum condenser fins behind
- Fins appear dark/heavily soiled; debris embedded in several areas
- Numerous bent/flattened fins across face
- Tall grass/weeds growing against/into the coil guard
- Brand label worn/cracked (cosmetic)

Potential Issues:
- Airflow restriction from clogged/dirty condenser coil
- Bent/flattened fins reducing heat exchange efficiency
- Vegetation contacting unit blocking airflow; potential pest harborage
- Debris/foreign material lodged in fins
- Minor dents in coil guard

Recommendations:
- Clean condenser coil thoroughly (professional service preferred)
- Straighten fins with a fin comb where possible
- Clear vegetation at least 2â€“3 ft around unit; maintain regular trimming
- Remove debris lodged in fins; install/maintain coil guard as needed
- Have HVAC technician evaluate performance after cleaning and repair any damaged coil sections
