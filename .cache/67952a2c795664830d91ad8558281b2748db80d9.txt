Location:
- Under kitchen sink, cabinet rear wall.

Observations:
- White PVC P-trap with slip-joint nuts; grey curved drain elbow into wall; black sink tailpiece above; braided supply lines to shut-off valve.
- Wall opening behind with expanding foam/insulation exposed.
- Apparent use of hose-type clamps on PVC joints.

Potential Issues:
- Possible S-trap configuration (vertical drop after trap) which can siphon and allow sewer gas entry.
- Nonstandard hose clamps at PVC joints (potential leak risk; not a code-approved connection).
- Unsealed wall opening with foam; potential moisture/pest intrusion.
- Inadequate support/strapping of drain components (stress on joints possible).

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber reconfigure to a proper vented P-trap with a horizontal trap arm to the wall and correct venting.
- Replace nonstandard clamps with proper slip-nut washers or approved fittings; ensure joints are clean and properly sealed.
- Secure and support all drain runs; ensure proper slope (trap arm 1/4 in per ft).
- Seal and finish wall opening; restore proper cabinet/wall finish to prevent moisture/pest ingress.
- Perform a leak test after changes and address any drips or leaks immediately.
