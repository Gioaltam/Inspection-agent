Location:
- Kitchen countertop, backsplash, and upper/lower cabinets (small-appliance area)

Observations:
- White painted wood cabinets; brass/bronze pulls/hinges
- White laminate/solid-surface counter with short backsplash
- Countertop appliances present (microwave, toaster, coffee maker, slow cooker)
- Two duplex receptacles at backsplash (left appears standard; right may be GFCI)
- Discoloration noted on underside seam of upper cabinets
- Several cabinet doors/drawers slightly uneven; paint wear/chips on lower doors

Potential Issues:
- Misalignment and uneven gaps at several lower cabinet doors; likely loose/shifted hinges
- Paint chips with minor substrate exposure on cabinet faces/edges
- Stains/discoloration under upper cabinets near center seam; possible grease/moisture
- Left countertop receptacle appears nonâ€‘GFCI; possible lack of required GFCI protection for counter circuits
- Heat-producing toaster located directly beneath upper cabinets (potential heat/fire hazard to cabinetry)

Recommendations:
- Adjust/secure hinges; realign doors; replace worn hardware as needed
- Sand/spot-prime exposed wood and repaint cabinet faces/edges
- Clean and degrease underside of upper cabinets; monitor for recurring staining and investigate moisture source if stains return
- Verify GFCI protection for all countertop receptacles; install/upgrade GFCI where missing
- Relocate toaster forward or away from upper cabinets; maintain safe clearance during use
- Inspect backsplash-to-wall joints and recaulk/seal if any gaps are present
