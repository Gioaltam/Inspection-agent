Location:
- Living/dining room with window/slider wall and adjacent hallway/bedroom doorway

Observations:
- Dark vinyl plank flooring; white baseboards
- Painted drywall/ceiling; ceiling fan
- Wall return-air grille above hallway opening
- Curtains to floor at window/slider
- Small table/chairs; TV/mount equipment near wall

Potential Issues:
- Return-air grille appears dusty; may restrict airflow
- Curtains drag on floor; minor trip hazard and dust collection
- Unsecured TV/mount leaning against wall; tip hazard
- No visible cracks, gaps, warping, water stains, corrosion, mold, or exposed wiring observed

Recommendations:
- Clean return-air grille and replace HVAC filter; evaluate duct cleanliness if buildup persists
- Hem/raise curtains to clear floor
- Secure TV/mount to stand/wall and manage cords to prevent tipping/tripping
- Continue routine monitoring for any developing wall/ceiling cracks or flooring separation
