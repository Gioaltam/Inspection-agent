Location:
- Utility/storage closet (exact location not confirmed)

Observations:
- Electric, tank-type water heater; white steel jacket, two access panels
- Top-mounted hot/cold lines; labels aged/worn
- Items stored on/against the tank
- TPR valve/discharge not visible from this view
- Drain pan not visible
- No seismic strapping seen
- Top cover shows dirt/grime; minor surface discoloration at fittings

Potential Issues:
- Storage/combustibles contacting tank; blocked service/access clearance
- TPR discharge pipe not visible; missing/improper relief piping is a safety hazard
- No drain pan visible (risk of water damage if unit leaks)
- No seismic strapping visible (may be required in some jurisdictions)
- Possible surface corrosion/oxidation at top fittings/cover
- Access panels may be loose/missing fasteners (potential exposed wiring/insulation)

Recommendations:
- Remove stored items; maintain manufacturer-required clearances around unit
- Verify/install proper TPR valve and full-size discharge line to approved termination
- Install drain pan with routed drain if required/appropriate for location
- Add seismic strapping where required by local code
- Have a licensed plumber evaluate unit for age/condition; service or replace as needed
- Secure access panel(s); replace any missing screws
- Clean and inspect top connections; address corrosion, replace nipples/dielectric unions and re-seal as needed
- Consider pipe insulation and an expansion tank if required by local code
