Location:
- Interior ceiling/soffit area with a rectangular HVAC register

Observations:
- Textured painted drywall ceiling
- Metal ceiling register with two visible mounting screws; adjustable louvers
- Register appears slightly proud of surface due to heavy texture
- Light dust accumulation visible on louvers/interior
- No visible water stains or rust on register or ceiling

Potential Issues:
- Minor dust/debris buildup on register
- Slight perimeter gap/uneven contact between register frame and textured ceiling
- No visible cracks, dents, corrosion, or leaks

Recommendations:
- Clean register and surrounding grille; vacuum/brush louvers
- Check/replace HVAC filter and verify proper airflow
- If this is a return, seal perimeter (caulk/foam gasket) to limit air bypass and dust draw
- Confirm register is secure and seated evenly against ceiling
