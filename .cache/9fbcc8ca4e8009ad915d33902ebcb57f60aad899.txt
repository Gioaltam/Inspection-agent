Location:
- Front exterior of a single-story ranch-style home. Address visible: 3351. Siding is light green with red trim/shutters. Screened porch on the right. Brick/stone-edged garden bed along the front.

Observations:
- Low-slope asphalt shingle roof with overhang; exterior window with shutters; well-defined garden bed with edging stones.
- Driveway has a long, weathered wooden board/debris lying across it toward the yard.
- Lawn is patchy/dry in spots; minimal visible staining on siding; no obvious water intrusion evidence.

Potential Issues:
- Trip hazard from loose, weathered wooden board lying on driveway/yard.
- Wood debris in contact with soil could indicate rot or pest risk (termite/wood-destroying insects).

Recommendations:
- Remove or securely store the debris; replace any rotten wood.
- Inspect adjacent wood edging/any remaining structural wood for rot or pest damage; treat or replace as needed and reseal caulk joints if signs of deterioration are found.
- Clean up yard debris and monitor drainage to maintain soil/soil-wood contact conditions.
