Location:
- Front yard curbside mailbox on a wooden post near sidewalk.

Observations:
- White metal mailbox with address 904.
- Dent/crease on the top front edge of the mailbox.
- Red mail flag present but appears bent/damaged.
- Wood post and cross-brace are weathered with peeling paint.
- Several small screws along the bottom edge of the mailbox; some may be rusted or missing.
- Post base and surrounding soil/grass show typical moisture exposure; no clear staining inside the mailbox.

Potential Issues:
- Dent in the mailbox door could affect closure/seal.
- Loose or missing/rusty fasteners mounting the mailbox.
- Weathered wood post with peeling paint; potential rot at base.
- Rust on screws/fasteners; possible future failure of mounting.
- Substrate exposure and potential pest/rot entry at the post.

Recommendations:
- Tighten/replace fasteners; use corrosion-resistant hardware; ensure secure mounting.
- Inspect post base for rot; replace post or reinforce with a new mounted bracket if soft/spongy.
- Repaint/seal wood post; treat for moisture resistance.
- Consider replacing dented mailbox or straightening/realigning for proper operation.
- Replace damaged/absent mail flag if needed.
