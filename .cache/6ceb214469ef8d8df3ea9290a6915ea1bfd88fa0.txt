Location: Exterior lap siding (lower course near base/deck)

What I See:
- Blistered/peeling paint with swelling in the board.
- Cracks/holes in the siding and a gap along the lap joint; spray foam visible at the base.

Issues to Address:
- Damaged siding board (cracked/open and swollen) allowing water intrusion.
- Open joint/seam needs sealing.

Recommended Action:
- Probe the area for softness; replace any deteriorated siding sections. If sound, dry out, scrape to bare, patch with exterior wood epoxy, sand, prime, and repaint.
- Re-caulk joints with high-quality exterior sealant; ensure proper flashing.
- Remove/trim exposed spray foam and replace with proper backer rod/sealant or trim detail.
- Check for water source/splashback and maintain clearance above deck/grade.
