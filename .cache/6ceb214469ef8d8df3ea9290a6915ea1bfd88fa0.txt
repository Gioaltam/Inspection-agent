Location: Exterior wall siding (lower course near grade/threshold)

What I See:
- Paint is blistered and peeling with a puncture/tear; siding face looks swollen.
- Gap along the lap joint; expanding foam visible at the bottom edge.

Issues to Address:
- Siding board shows moisture damage/delamination with a hole and failing paint film.
- Open joints that can admit water.
- Exposed spray foam at base is not UV/weather rated and can retain moisture.

Recommended Action:
- Probe the area for softness; replace the damaged siding section if deteriorated.
- Seal joints properly (backer rod + exterior-grade sealant) and ensure correct clearance from grade.
- Remove or cover the exposed foam with proper flashing/trim; address the moisture source (e.g., splashback, missing kick-out/flashing).
- Prime and repaint repaired areas with exterior-grade products.
