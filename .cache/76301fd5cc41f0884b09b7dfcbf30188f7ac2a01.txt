Location:
- Exterior eave/soffit at corner above window/door; near roll-down shutter housing.

Observations:
- Perforated vinyl/aluminum soffit panels with metal fascia.
- Roll-down shutter box mounted at header.
- Exterior cable run feeding shutter; loosely routed along wall.
- Dense vegetation contacting soffit/wall.
- Small unused anchor/screw holes in wall finish near shutter track.

Potential Issues:
- Gap/void at soffit corner above shutter box; panel appears displaced/loose → open access to eave.
- Unprotected/loosely supported exterior wiring; not in conduit and vulnerable to damage.
- Vegetation in contact with structure and wiring; potential abrasion and pest bridge.
- Unsealed wall fastener holes/penetrations → possible water intrusion and insect entry.

Recommendations:
- Refit/secure or replace soffit panel(s); close gaps with proper J-channel/fascia; add screen if needed.
- Inspect eave/attic for pests/moisture; seal any entry points.
- Have a licensed electrician correct wiring: route in listed exterior conduit or use rated cable; secure with proper supports; terminate in weatherproof box.
- Trim vegetation back 1–2 ft from structure and maintain clearance.
- Seal/patch unused wall holes with exterior-grade sealant/repair compound.
- Clean soffit vents to keep attic ventilation free-flowing.
