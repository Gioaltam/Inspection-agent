Location:
- Exterior eave/soffit above window; corner area with awning/shutter box and nearby vegetation

Observations:
- Vented vinyl soffit panels with aluminum fascia/drip edge
- Metal awning/roll‑shutter housing mounted tight to soffit corner
- Exposed cable run along wall/soffit; loosely secured at corner
- Stucco wall around window; two open fastener holes visible
- Dense plants contacting wall/soffit

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at soffit termination around housing/corner—possible pest entry points
- Unsecured exterior cable; exposed to weather and not in conduit; possible improper wiring protection
- Open fastener holes in stucco—potential water intrusion
- Vegetation contacting structure—can abrade finishes and obstruct soffit ventilation

Recommendations:
- Repair/secure soffit edges and any loose J‑channel; close openings with proper trim/bug screen
- Have a licensed electrician secure wiring in approved exterior raceway/conduit and verify cable type/rating
- Seal and patch stucco fastener holes with exterior-grade sealant/repair mortar; paint to match
- Service/realign awning/shutter housing as needed to ensure tight fit at soffit
- Trim vegetation back 12–24 in. from structure and maintain clearance
