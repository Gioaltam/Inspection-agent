Location:
- Exterior steel entry door with Schlage keypad deadbolt and lever handle.

Observations:
- Door surface shows extensive paint chipping and multiple rust spots.
- Rust and flaking paint evident around latch area and along edge of door.
- Edge near frame appears chipped; no visible cracks in the door skin.
- Interior view shows standard lever handle; no other hardware visible.

Potential Issues:
- Surface rust and paint failure with possible corrosion-through risk.
- Exposed substrate at edge could allow moisture intrusion and long-term deterioration.
- Possible frame/strike wear from corrosion or misalignment (not visible but suggested by edge condition).
- Inadequate or degraded weather seal implied by edge/paint condition (not directly visible).

Recommendations:
- Inspect and treat rust; remove loose paint, apply rust inhibitor, and repaint with exterior-grade coating.
- Inspect door frame and strike alignment; repair/replace damaged areas if frame shows corrosion or deformation.
- Replace or reseal weatherstripping to improve seal and energy efficiency.
- Evaluate door for security; ensure proper latch alignment and operation of deadbolt; consider replacement if corrosion affects integrity.
