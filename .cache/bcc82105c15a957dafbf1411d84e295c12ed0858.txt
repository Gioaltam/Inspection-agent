Location:
- Exterior window, stucco wall

Observations:
- Painted window frame (appears metal/vinyl) with insect screen installed
- Dark screen frame with center crossbar; black spline around perimeter
- Screen mesh wrinkled, not taut; folds at bottom edge
- Interior blinds visible behind glass

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at screen-to-frame edges, especially bottom and corners
- Loose/missing spline in areas; screen not seated tightly
- Screen frame misaligned within window channel
- Pest entry points due to poor screen fit

Recommendations:
- Re-spline and tighten mesh; reseat screen properly in frame
- If frame is warped or undersized, replace screen assembly
- Clean window tracks and ensure weep holes are open
- Verify window sash operation and that perimeter caulk remains intact
