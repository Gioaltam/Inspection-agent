Location:
- Bathroom vanity/sink area

Observations:
- Laminate countertop with drop-in sink; large wall mirror
- Exposed-bulb vanity light above mirror
- Gray embossed wall panels used as partial backsplash
- Electrical receptacle to right of sink with multi-outlet adapter
- Paint scraped/peeling on wall behind sink
- Faucet shows corrosion/mineral buildup
- Countertop edges chipped; laminate worn
- Gap/damage at left side cabinet/wall near toilet

Potential Issues:
- Countertop edge damage/delamination with substrate exposure
- Failed/missing caulk at counter-to-wall joint and around sink; visible gaps
- Wall paint peeling/stained behind sink—moisture exposure; possible past leak
- Corrosion/mineral deposits on faucet—possible leak or hard-water damage
- Non-GFCI receptacle by sink with multi-outlet adapter—shock hazard
- Backsplash panels misaligned with unsealed edges—moisture intrusion risk
- Open gaps/damaged paneling at left side—possible pest entry/moisture damage
- Exposed-bulb light near water; no cover—safety concern if not damp-rated

Recommendations:
- Replace receptacle with GFCI-protected unit; remove multi-outlet adapter
- Reseal with silicone: sink rim and counter-to-wall seam; seal backsplash edges
- Repair/replace damaged laminate countertop; add proper continuous backsplash
- Service/replace faucet; check for active leaks; clean mineral buildup
- Scrape/repair drywall; prime with moisture-resistant product and repaint
- Verify vanity light is damp-rated; add appropriate cover or replace fixture
- Repair/finish side panel/wall and close gaps to deter pests
- Clean surfaces; improve bathroom ventilation to reduce humidity
