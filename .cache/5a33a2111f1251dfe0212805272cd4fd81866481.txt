Location:
- Utility closet/mechanical space housing a residential water heater.

Observations:
- Electric-style vertical storage water heater; enamel tank with EnergyGuide label.
- Top area partially covered by a plastic bag.
- No visible drip pan or floor drain around the unit.
- Exterior appears dirty but no obvious active leaks visible from/photo.
- Piping/valves at the top not clearly visible.

Potential Issues:
- Plastic bag covering top could obstruct access and venting (if gas-fired) or maintenance.
- No visible TPR valve discharge pipe (not clearly seen in image).
- No drain pan or secondary containment noted (leak risk).
- Unclear age of unit; potential remaining life unknown.
- Cramped installation; limited side clearance could affect service/venting.

Recommendations:
- Remove bag to inspect top connections and venting (if gas) or access panel (if electric).
- Verify TPR valve and proper discharge piping directed to a safe location.
- Install a drain pan with a drain or ensure floor drain is present; locate and route a safe leak path.
- Confirm need for expansion tank per local code.
- Have a licensed plumber/tech inspect for proper venting (gas) or electrical connections and consider replacement if unit shows signs of wear or is near end of life.
