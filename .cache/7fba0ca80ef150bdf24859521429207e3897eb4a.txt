Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet (under-sink)

Observations:
- PVC tubular P-trap with slip-joint nuts
- Flexible corrugated hose entering wall; secured with metal hose clamp
- Rough/oversized wall penetration around hose; no escutcheon/trim ring
- Laminate cabinet floor; light brown discoloration on back panel beneath trap

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at wall penetration around hose (possible pest entry/odor path)
- Water staining on back wall below trap indicates prior or intermittent leak at trap/tailpiece
- Missing/failed sealant at wall penetration; substrate exposure at cutout

Recommendations:
- Test plumbing under flow; tighten/replace slip-joint washers as needed; repair any active leak
- Clean and monitor area for recurring moisture
- Properly seal wall penetration (escutcheon and caulk/foam) to close gaps; protect cut edges
- If leaks persist or fittings are damaged, have a licensed plumber evaluate and repair
- Optional: add a moisture alarm in cabinet for early leak detection
