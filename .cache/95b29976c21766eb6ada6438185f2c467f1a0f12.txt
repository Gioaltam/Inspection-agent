Location:
- Interior ceiling vent/register near light fixture

Observations:
- White 4-way metal register with adjustable louvers
- Multiple louvers bent/deformed; one appears cracked/partially missing
- Noticeable dust/soiling on slats and inside duct boot
- Small gap and drywall chipping at top-right perimeter
- All corner screws present; no obvious rust or water stains

Potential Issues:
- Dents/bends, cracked/missing louvers; misalignment may restrict airflow
- Gap/void at perimeter; potential air leakage and pest entry path
- Accumulated dust/soiling; possible irritant and reduced efficiency
- Sharp edges from damaged slats present minor cut hazard
- No visible corrosion or water intrusion

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged register/vent cover with correct size/style
- Clean duct boot and surrounding area; vacuum and wipe louvers/inside
- Seal perimeter to ceiling with caulk/foam gasket; patch/paint drywall chips
- Inspect duct connection behind grille for leaks; secure as needed
- If part of HVAC: check/replace filters and balance airflow; if bathroom exhaust: clean/verify fan performance and exterior termination
