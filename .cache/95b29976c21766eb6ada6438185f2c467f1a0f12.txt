Location:
- Ceiling vent/register near light fixture (interior room)

Observations:
- Metal grille with multiple plastic louver sections
- Noticeable dust/soil on louvers and inside boot
- Several louvers cracked/bent/warped; one section deformed
- Frame not flush to ceiling; small perimeter gaps
- Drywall chipped at top-right edge of opening
- One corner screw missing (top-left); other screws present

Potential Issues:
- Bent/warped and cracked louvers restricting airflow
- Loose/missing fastener; grille may be insecure
- Gaps/voids at perimeter; potential air leakage, dust streaking, and pest entry
- Substrate exposure at damaged drywall edge; vulnerable to moisture damage
- Misalignment of louver sections reducing performance
- Debris buildup that can reduce air quality/efficiency

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged register/grille with properly sized unit
- Secure with all required screws/anchors; verify grille sits flush
- Clean register and duct boot; service/replace HVAC filters; consider duct cleaning if debris is heavy
- Patch/paint damaged drywall; seal or caulk small perimeter gaps after repair
- Confirm proper airflow and damper operation after replacement
