Location:
- Lower interior wall corner next to gray appliance/cabinet; at floor line

Observations:
- Vinyl/laminate plank flooring
- Painted plaster/drywall corner; corner bead area
- Baseboard/trim absent at this corner
- Plaster/drywall chipped/spalled; substrate/wood visible
- Rough/failed caulk along floor-wall/appliance edge
- Abrasion consistent with appliance contact

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/spalling with loose/missing wall finish and corner bead
- Gaps/voids at base; exposed substrate
- Failed/missing sealant at floor-to-wall joint
- Localized discoloration of exposed wood suggests prior moisture; risk of water intrusion from nearby appliance
- Sharp broken edges; minor injury hazard
- Openings may serve as pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Check adjacent appliance and nearby plumbing for leaks; test wall/floor with moisture meter
- Remove loose material; repair/replace damaged drywall/plaster and corner bead
- Install/replace baseboard and shoe molding; properly seal floor-to-wall joint with quality caulk
- If moisture confirmed, correct source, dry area, and treat any damaged/rotted wood before finishing
- Maintain clearance so appliance does not impact corner; consider a corner guard to prevent recurrence
