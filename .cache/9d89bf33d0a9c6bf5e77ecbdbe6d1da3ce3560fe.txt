Location:
- Under kitchen sink cabinet, right side.

Observations:
- White PVC sink drain tailpiece connects to a vertical/tee-style drain assembly with slip-joint fittings.
- Horizontal drain arm runs left toward the wall; slip-joint connections appear intact.
- Cabinet clutter with cleaning products and bags; some flexible hoses visible (likely faucet/dishwasher lines).
- Drain area not showing active corrosion or staining in this view.

Potential Issues:
- P-trap presence cannot be confirmed from this photo; lack or misorientation of a proper P-trap could allow sewer gas leaks.
- Dishwasher/drain hose visibility suggests possible connection without a clear air-gap or proper high loop.
- Slip-joint/gasket seats may be prone to leaks if not tight or if washers are worn; no leak observed but potential risk.
- Clutter around plumbing can hide leaks or hinder access for future maintenance.

Recommendations:
- Verify that a correctly configured P-trap is installed and visible (proper orientation, tight slip-nuts, intact washers).
- Ensure any dishwasher drain is looped high or has an air-gap as required by code.
- Tighten and inspect all slip-joint connections; replace worn washers if any moisture is detected.
- Clear the cabinet area to improve access and monitoring for leaks; secure hoses to prevent kinks or abrasion.
