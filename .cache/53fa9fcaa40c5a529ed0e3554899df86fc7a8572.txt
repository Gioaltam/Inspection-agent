Location:
- Living room/main living area with sliding door at rear

Observations:
- Vinyl/laminate plank flooring; painted drywall walls; textured ceiling
- Sliding glass door with fabric curtains on rod; white baseboards
- Sectional sofa, armchair, lamp, TV stand; folding side tables in walkway
- Ceiling fan (partial view)
- Power cords concentrated near TV stand
- No smoke/CO alarms visible in this view

Potential Issues:
- Trip/fall hazards: folding tables and furniture encroaching main walkway
- Egress partially obstructed at sliding door by chair/tables
- Cable management: loose cords near walkway present trip risk
- No visible cracks, gaps, warping, stains, mold, water damage, or corrosion noted in this view

Recommendations:
- Reconfigure furniture to maintain clear, unobstructed path to the sliding door
- Secure/organize cords with clips/covers; keep off walking paths
- Confirm presence and operation of smoke/CO alarms per local code
- Routine cleaning and monitor flooring for future gaps/lifting
