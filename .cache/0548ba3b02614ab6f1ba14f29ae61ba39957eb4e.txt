Location:
- Exterior side of house, foundation grade area with blue vinyl siding and gable roof overhang; landscaping bed along the wall.

Observations:
- Vinyl siding appears intact with no obvious cracks or warping.
- Ground vegetation and mulch directly against the siding and along the foundation.
- Loose/untethered white cords or wires running along the siding surface near mid-height.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with siding and foundation (moisture retention, pest access, potential rot).
- Grading/soil right up to the foundation (restricts drainage and can promote moisture intrusion).
- Loose exterior cords/wires posing trip hazard and potential moisture/or electrical risk if exposed to weather.

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove vegetation that touches siding; keep at least 12 inches clearance from siding.
- Regrade soil away from the foundation to improve drainage; add splash blocks or extend downspouts away from the wall.
- Secure and protect exterior wiring with outdoor-rated components or conduit; ensure cords are weatherproof and not in contact with the siding.
- Inspect lower edge of siding for any minor gaps or sealant needs and address if present.
