Location:
- Exterior; ground-mounted HVAC condensing unit

Observations:
- Outdoor AC/heat-pump condenser; model RP1430AJ1NA, MFD 12/2018, R‑410A
- Metal cabinet with intact data/warning labels
- Refrigerant lines enter right side; suction line foam present but looks weathered/short at cabinet
- Vegetation/grass in contact with unit base

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting cabinet may obstruct airflow and invite pests
- Deteriorated/insufficient suction-line insulation with small area of exposed copper near cabinet

Recommendations:
- Clear/trim vegetation to maintain 12–24 in. clearance around unit
- Re-insulate suction line with UV-resistant foam up to cabinet penetration
- Continue routine HVAC service/cleaning per manufacturer schedule
