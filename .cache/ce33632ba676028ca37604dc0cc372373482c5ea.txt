Location:
- Ceiling-mounted HVAC grille/register

Observations:
- Rectangular white metal grille with side screws
- Surrounding drywall shows rough patching/caulk and paint ridges
- Minor paint chipping at corners of opening
- Visible dust/debris on louvers and inside duct
- One louver appears slightly bent; frame a bit skewed

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids and failed/uneven caulk around perimeter (air leakage, dust entry)
- Bent/misaligned louver; potential loose fit
- Paint cracking/peeling with minor substrate exposure at edges
- Dust buildup may restrict airflow/affect air quality
- No visible water stains, rust/corrosion, or mold

Recommendations:
- Remove and clean grille; vacuum/clean accessible duct; replace HVAC filter as needed
- Reseat and tighten fasteners; straighten or replace damaged grille
- Properly seal register boot to drywall with mastic/caulk; patch and repaint surrounding area
- If leakage/noise persists, have HVAC contractor evaluate boot connection and air balance
