Location:
- Bathroom tub/shower alcove; ceiling and tile surround

Observations:
- Ceramic tile surround; grout appears mostly intact
- Fiberglass/porcelain tub
- Tension-mounted metal shower rod with plastic liner
- Ceiling-mounted exhaust fan with pull cord; cover not flush

Potential Issues:
- Exhaust fan grille/trim loose/misaligned with visible gap at ceiling; possible missing/broken fastener
- Mildew/discoloration visible on shower curtain liner
- Liner bunched/not fully hung; potential for water to escape onto floor (slip hazard)

Recommendations:
- Secure or replace fan cover; clean fan housing; verify fan operates, is ducted outdoors, shower-rated, and GFCI-protected due to location over tub
- Clean/replace shower liner; hang properly to contain water
- Inspect caulk at tub-to-tile and vertical corners; reseal with silicone where gaps or deterioration are found
