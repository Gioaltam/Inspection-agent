Location:
- HVAC return/air handler filter rack

Observations:
- Pleated 14x18x1 furnace/AC filter installed
- Filter media heavily loaded with dust/debris
- Interior duct/return plenum surfaces dusty
- Duct liner/insulation at bottom appears torn with fiberglass exposed

Potential Issues:
- Severely clogged filter restricting airflow; can overwork blower and reduce efficiency
- Substrate exposure: torn duct liner with fiberglass exposed to airstream
- Loose debris in return plenum can be drawn into equipment and distributed in home
- Indoor air quality concern from accumulated dust and exposed insulation

Recommendations:
- Replace filter now with correct size/MERV; verify airflow arrow orientation
- Establish regular change interval (about 1â€“3 months or per manufacturer)
- Vacuum/clean return plenum; remove loose debris
- Repair or replace damaged duct liner/insulation; seal edges to prevent fiber shedding
- Have HVAC technician evaluate overall airflow and condition of return plenum and liner
