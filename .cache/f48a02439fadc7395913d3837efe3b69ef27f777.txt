Location:
- HVAC return air filter slot/air handler area (filter size label 14 x 18 x 1).

Observations:
- Pleated filter is very dusty/dirt-laden.
- Surrounding plenum surfaces also coated with dust.
- No visible water stains or mold noted in photo.
- No wiring or structural damage visible.

Potential Issues:
- Dirty/blocked filter may reduce airflow and system efficiency.
- Dust buildup could indicate bypass/leak at the filter frame if not seating properly.

Recommendations:
- Replace with a new 14 x 18 x 1 filter; ensure proper seating and no gaps.
- Consider upgrading to an appropriate higher-MERV filter if compatible with the system; schedule regular filter changes (every 1â€“3 months).
- Inspect the filter frame/seal for gaps and clean the surrounding area to reduce dust circulation.
- If dust recurs or airflow symptoms appear, have HVAC technician perform a fuller inspection for leaks, duct cleanliness, and overall system performance.
