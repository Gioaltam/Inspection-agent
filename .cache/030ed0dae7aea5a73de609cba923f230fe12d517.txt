Location: HVAC air handler closet

What I See:
- 18x20x1 return air filter is very dirty and bowed, not seated tightly in the rack.
- Light dust/debris on the unit face; filter gap could allow air bypass.

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the 18x20x1 filter now; install with airflow arrow toward the unit.
- Ensure the filter slot seals tightly (use correct-size filter, intact cover/clips) to prevent air bypass and bowing.
- After replacement, monitor airflow; if weak or coil ices, have an HVAC tech inspect and clean the blower/coil due to possible past dust buildup.
- Set a regular filter change schedule (about every 1â€“3 months depending on use).
