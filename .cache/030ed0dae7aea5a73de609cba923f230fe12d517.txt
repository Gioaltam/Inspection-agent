Location: HVAC closet – air handler/filter

What I See:
- 18x20x1 return filter is very dirty and bowed, likely restricting airflow.
- Cabinet shows normal surface wear; no obvious leaks visible at the filter slot.

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the filter now with a properly fitting 18x20x1 (MERV 8–11). Ensure the airflow arrow points toward the unit and the filter seats fully with no gaps.
- Vacuum/clean the filter slot and nearby return area; set a 1–3 month replacement reminder.
- If you’ve noticed weak airflow, unusual noise, or coil icing, have an HVAC tech inspect the blower and evaporator coil since a clogged filter can cause strain.
