Location: Front entry door

What I See:
- Electronic keypad deadbolt and lever handle appear properly installed.
- Door and jamb have peeling/chipped paint with some bare wood showing.

Issues to Address:
- Peeling/chipped paint on door and jamb exposing wood.

Recommended Action:
- Scrape loose paint, sand, spot-prime any bare wood, and repaint with exterior-grade paint. Re-caulk gaps at trim as needed. Confirm locks operate smoothly after repainting.
