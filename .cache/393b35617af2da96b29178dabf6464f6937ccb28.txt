Location: Front door

What I See:
- Keypad deadbolt and lever handle installed.
- Door and jamb/trim have peeling paint and cracked/failed caulk; some bare wood visible around edges/hardware.

Issues to Address:
- Failed exterior paint/caulk on door and jamb exposing wood.

Recommended Action:
- Scrape and sand loose paint, spot-prime all bare wood, and repaint with exterior-grade paint.
- Re-caulk open seams at the casing/jamb with paintable exterior sealant.
- Seal around the lock escutcheons to keep moisture out; tighten hardware after work is complete.
