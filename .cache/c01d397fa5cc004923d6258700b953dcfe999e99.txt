Location: Shower/tub base

What I See:
- Peeling/delaminated topcoat on the shower pan surface.
- Caulk at the pan-to-wall seam is thin with small gaps/discoloration.

Issues to Address:
- Peeling surface finish on the shower pan.
- Failed caulk at the pan-to-wall joint (water-intrusion risk).

Recommended Action:
- If the pan is solid (no flexing), clean/sand the affected area and repair with an acrylic/fiberglass tub repair or refinishing kit; consider professional reglazing if the peeling is widespread.
- Remove all old caulk, clean and dry the joint, then apply a continuous bead of mildew-resistant 100% silicone; allow full cure before use and monitor for leaks.
