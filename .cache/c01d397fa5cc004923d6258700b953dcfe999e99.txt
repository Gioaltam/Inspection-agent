Location: Shower/tub base

What I See:
- Peeling/delaminating surface finish or non-slip coating on the base.
- Caulk at the wall-to-base joint appears split/gapped in spots.

Issues to Address:
- Peeling/delaminated finish on the shower/tub base.
- Failed/missing caulk at the back seam (risk of water intrusion behind surround).

Recommended Action:
- Remove all loose coating, clean and dry, then repair with a tub/shower refinishing or nonâ€‘slip coating kit; consider professional refinishing or pan replacement if the damage is widespread.
- Cut out old caulk, clean and dry the joint, and apply 100% silicone bath caulk; allow full cure before use.
