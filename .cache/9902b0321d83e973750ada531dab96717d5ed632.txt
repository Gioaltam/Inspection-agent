Location:
- Exterior, ground beside house at outdoor A/C condenser

Observations:
- Metal condenser unit adjacent to wall
- Dense tall grass/weeds around and touching unit
- White PVC drain line discharging onto soil next to unit
- Insulated refrigerant line and flexible electrical conduit present
- Ground appears wet/puddled beneath vegetation

Potential Issues:
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: Vegetation obstructs condenser airflow and service access
- Water intrusion/leaks/stains: Standing water/pooling at base from drain discharge near foundation
- Trip/fall hazard: Overgrowth conceals uneven ground and lines
- Pest attraction: Vegetation and standing water can harbor insects/rodents near structure

Recommendations:
- Cut/clear vegetation and maintain 12â€“24 in. clearance around condenser
- Extend drain/condensate discharge away from unit and foundation; use splash block or piping to proper termination to prevent pooling
- After clearing, verify unit sits on a solid, level pad with proper clearance
- Monitor/treat for pests if activity noted after water is managed
