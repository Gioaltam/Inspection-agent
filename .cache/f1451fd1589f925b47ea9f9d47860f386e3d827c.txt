Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit (AC) mounted/placed against exterior, with label on the right panel.

Observations:
- Condenser coil fins visible behind grille; cabinet panels appear intact.
- Label present and legible.
- Debris/vegetation at the base (dried grass, straw) around the lower enclosure.
- No obvious dents, cracks, or loose/missing fasteners seen in the visible area.

Potential Issues:
- Debris/vegetation at the base could impede airflow and trap moisture.
- Unknown clearance around sides/top; may be insufficient for proper condenser airflow.

Recommendations:
- Clear debris and vegetation from around the unit; maintain several inches to feet of clearance on all sides.
- If fins are dirty, gently clean or use a fin comb to straighten any bent sections.
- Have a technician verify refrigerant charge and electrical connections during the next service.
