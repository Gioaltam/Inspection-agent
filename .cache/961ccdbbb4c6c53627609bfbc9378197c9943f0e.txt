Location:
- Under-sink area, kitchen trash/disposal cabinet.

Observations:
- Garbage disposal mounted to sink drain with a rusty, corroded mounting flange/ring.
- Dishwasher drain hose connected to disposal inlet with a hose clamp.
- White PVC P-trap/drain visible; cabinet bottom shows moisture staining/dirt.
- General grime around disposal; possible past leakage.

Potential Issues:
- Corroded mounting flange/ring; potential leak at sink/disposal connection.
- Evidence of moisture staining on cabinet bottom (possible past or ongoing leak).
- Rust/oxidation near the flange could indicate seal failure or future failure.
- Dishwasher/drain connection should be checked for secure seal; ensure proper loop or air gap.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and reseal sink-to-disposal junction; replace corroded mounting hardware and gasket as needed.
- Inspect cabinet for water damage; dry out and repair/replace damaged wood if necessary; treat for mold if present.
- Check and tighten/repair P-trap joints; ensure all seals are intact.
- Verify dishwasher drain connection; ensure proper high loop or air gap per code; reseal clamp if needed.
- Consider replacing disposal if unit is aged or showing recurring leaks.
