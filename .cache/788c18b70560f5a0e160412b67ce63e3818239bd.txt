Location:
- Front exterior view of a single-story brick residence with concrete driveway and front entry stairs.

Observations:
- Brick veneer exterior; two front windows with white trim; small front porch/landing with two steps.
- Left neighbor fence; right side shows a neighboring green house.
- Driveway has visible cracks and surface wear; lawn is patchy/dry in places.
- Roof appears asphalt shingles; gable vent on left side.

Potential Issues:
- Cracked/varnish worn concrete driveway; trip/slip and water intrusion potential.
- No visible handrail on front stairs (safety concern).
- Gutters/downspouts not clearly visible; unknown drainage away from foundation.
- Ground/soil near foundation not clearly graded; potential moisture contact with brick.

Recommendations:
- Seal/repair driveway cracks; monitor for widening or spalling.
- Install a safety handrail on the front steps; ensure step/landing is level.
- Inspect gutters and downspouts; confirm proper discharge away from foundation.
- Verify grading and add soil or landscaping to direct water away from the foundation; maintain 6â€“8 inches clearance at siding.
