Location:
- Small closet/storage nook with shelves and tile floor

Observations:
- Painted drywall walls; patchy/unfinished paint in areas
- Three plywood shelves on side cleats/brackets; unfinished edges
- Ceramic/porcelain floor tile with grout; tile base at walls
- Misc. items stored (mop, paint cans, paper towel, trim pieces)

Potential Issues:
- Floor tile at bottom shows a diagonal crack
- Stains/discoloration on lower shelves
- Exposed/unfinished plywood edges (splinter risk; moisture absorption)
- Small uncaulked joints at tile-to-wall/base and shelf-to-wall interfaces
- Lightâ€‘duty shelf support (no front support) may sag if heavily loaded

Recommendations:
- Replace cracked floor tile; check for substrate movement before reinstall
- Clean/replace stained shelf boards; sand and seal/paint all shelf faces and edges
- Caulk/seal shelf-to-wall seams and tile/base joints
- If heavier storage intended, add front cleats or stronger brackets; confirm fasteners into studs
- Touch up/finish wall paint and perform general cleaning
