Location:
- Exterior window above flat roof/roof deck area

Observations:
- Sliding window with insect screen; aluminum/vinyl frame
- Interior pleated blind visible
- White coated sill/roof edge below window
- Screen has crossbar; latch/tab at lower right

Potential Issues:
- Screen mesh pulled loose at lower-right corner; visible gap for pest entry
- Screen frame appears slightly misaligned/not fully seated in bottom track
- Minor hairline cracks in paint/coating on exterior sill

Recommendations:
- Reseat/repair screen; replace/retuck spline and ensure latch/clips secure
- Adjust screen frame to fit squarely in tracks
- Seal/patch hairline cracks in sill coating to maintain weather protection
- Clean debris from sill and check/clear window weep holes
