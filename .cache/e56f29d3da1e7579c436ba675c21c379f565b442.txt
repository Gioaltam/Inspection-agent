Location:
- Right side yard/drive area beside house; view toward rear yard and wood gate

Observations:
- Single-story home; stucco exterior; gable roof; no gutters visible on this side
- Vinyl privacy fence with posts and caps along right property line
- Grass/dirt parking surface with vehicle ruts
- Single window with screen; decorative shutter at left side
- Tall shrubs/yucca planted tight to wall/eave near window
- Weathered wood gate/fence section at rear

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting wall/eave near window; potential pest bridge and siding/soffit abrasion
- Uneven, rutted ground with bare patches; trip/fall hazard and mud/erosion potential
- Wood gate appears weathered/unsealed; increased risk of decay and fastener failure

Recommendations:
- Trim/clear vegetation 6â€“12 in. from walls and away from soffit/roof; maintain clearance
- Regrade/level or install a proper driveway surface to reduce trip hazard and erosion
- Clean, seal, or replace weathered wood gate; check/secure hardware
- Monitor drainage; consider gutters/splash blocks if soil erosion occurs along this side
