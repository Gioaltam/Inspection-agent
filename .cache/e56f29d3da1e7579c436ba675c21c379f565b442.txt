Location:
- Right side yard/drive next to house and vinyl privacy fence

Observations:
- Single‑story home; stucco exterior; gable roof with metal drip edge; no gutters visible on this eave
- Vinyl privacy fence appears intact along property line
- Grass/dirt parking surface with ruts and bare patches
- Side window present; dense shrubs/yucca planted tight to wall/eave
- Overhead utility lines present above yard area
- Trash bin and wooden gate at rear; parked vehicles present

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting wall and eave/roof — abrasion, moisture retention, and pest bridge
- No gutters/downspouts on this run — potential splashback, erosion, and water near foundation
- Uneven grass/dirt parking surface — trip/fall hazard; poor drainage potential
- Overhead utility lines over work/parking area — shock hazard if contacted
- Stucco base appears close to soil in spots — potential moisture wicking and pest entry
- No other visible issues

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove vegetation to maintain 12–18 in. clearance from walls and several feet from roof/eaves
- Install gutters and downspouts with extensions to discharge 4–6 ft from foundation; verify grading slopes away
- Level/stabilize parking surface (gravel/pavers) to reduce tripping and improve drainage
- Maintain safe clearance from overhead lines; avoid ladder/tree work beneath; consult utility if needed
- Ensure 4–6 in. stucco-to-soil clearance; regrade or lower soil as needed; seal/paint repaired areas
- Re-caulk/paint around window and penetrations as needed; monitor fence for movement or damage over time
