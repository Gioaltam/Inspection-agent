Location:
- Exterior yard/patio edge beside wood fence and concrete pavers

Observations:
- Painted wood fence with vertical pickets; paint weathered
- Concrete paver walkway/patio; several pavers displaced
- Plastic landscape edging piece loose on surface
- Exposed green wire and black tubing along ground
- Algae/mildew staining on lower fence boards

Potential Issues:
- Uneven/sunken pavers with gaps/voids and misalignment — trip/fall hazard
- Missing/loose pavers and detached edge restraint
- Cracks/splits and warping in fence boards; gaps at base allowing pest entry
- Failed paint/sealant with exposed wood substrate
- Moisture staining/algae/mildew at fence base; possible early rot
- Exposed wiring/tubing on ground; likely not in conduit or properly buried — damage and safety risk

Recommendations:
- Relevel/reset pavers on proper base, add joint sand, replace missing/damaged units
- Reinstall/replace edge restraint to secure perimeter
- Clean algae/mildew; improve drainage/ground clearance; prep and repaint/seal fence; replace any rotted boards
- Secure/protect wiring: verify rating, place in conduit or bury to code; have qualified electrician/installer evaluate
- Seal/close gaps at fence bottom or add kickboard to deter pest entry and debris accumulation
