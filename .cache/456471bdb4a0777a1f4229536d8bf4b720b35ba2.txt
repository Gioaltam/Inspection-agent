Location:
- Exterior patio/walkway at base of white wooden fence

Observations:
- Painted vertical wood fence; green algae/mildew staining near bottom; splits/cracks in boards; peeling/eroded paint
- Gap under fence with daylight visible; soil/aggregate exposed
- Concrete pavers uneven/sunken; open joints with missing sand; edge restraint piece loose/detached
- Low‑voltage landscape wire visible between pavers; not in conduit/buried
- Debris and organic growth present along fence line

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/splits and failed paint on fence; moisture staining and possible wood rot at lower boards
- Gaps/voids under fence create pest entry points
- Misaligned/settled pavers and loose edging create trip/fall hazard; substrate exposure
- Exposed wiring without conduit/burial—risk of physical damage; improper installation
- Likely drainage/moisture problem contributing to algae and settlement

Recommendations:
- Clean algae/mildew; sand/prime/repaint fence; replace any rotted or severely cracked boards; maintain clearance from soil and seal cut ends
- Relevel pavers: lift, re-compact base, reinstall, and refill joints with polymeric sand; reinstall/secure edge restraint; replace damaged units
- Bury low‑voltage cable to proper depth or place in protective conduit; have qualified technician correct wiring
- Improve drainage along fence line (regrade/add gravel strip); remove debris and vegetation; monitor and block pest gaps under fence (e.g., kickboard or screening)
