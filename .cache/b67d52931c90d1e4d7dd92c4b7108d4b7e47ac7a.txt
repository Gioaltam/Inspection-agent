Location:
- Bathroom, toilet area.

Observations:
- White elongated toilet with metal sheet covering the top of the tank (appears improvised; dented and oversized).
- Open floor opening/rough-in hole near the toilet base with a dark ring around it.
- Base of toilet shows staining and appears not fully sealed to the floor.
- Wall tiles and toilet paper holder present; visible floor grout/tile finish.

Potential Issues:
- Exposed floor drain/rough-in next to toilet: trip hazard and potential sewer gas/pest entry.
- Improvised metal cover on toilet tank: potential leakage, non-code, possible tank damage.
- Missing or poor seal at toilet base; risk of water leakage and subfloor damage.
- Signs of past leakage (staining) near toilet base; possible subfloor rot.
- Possible corrosion or leakage risk on nearby plumbing connections (supply valve not clearly verified).

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber install a proper toilet flange/wax ring and reseal the toilet to the floor; re-caulk at the base.
- Remove metal tank cover; inspect tank for cracks or failure and replace lid or entire tank if needed.
- Inspect subfloor under and around the toilet for moisture damage; repair as necessary.
- Cover or properly cap/protect the open floor rough-in per code; ensure no sewer gas risk.
- Inspect and, if needed, replace the supply valve/line; ensure leaks are not present.
- Clean, disinfect, and re-seal to prevent mold/mildew; regrout if grout around area is compromised.
