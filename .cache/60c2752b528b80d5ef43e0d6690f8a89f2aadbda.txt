Location:
- Ceiling vent/register in interior room (exact room not confirmed)

Observations:
- Metal grille with two visible side screws
- Noticeable dust/soot on louvers and along perimeter
- Grille appears slightly skewed in opening
- Textured drywall ceiling with visible joint line and minor hairline cracks
- No obvious water stains or mold seen

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at grille perimeter allowing air leakage and dust streaking
- Possible loose/misaligned mounting of register
- Dust buildup may reduce airflow and circulate particulates
- Minor ceiling cracking at joint line

Recommendations:
- Remove and thoroughly clean grille; vacuum/wipe nearby duct/fan housing
- Reseat, align, and tighten fasteners
- Seal perimeter to ceiling with paintable caulk or a foam gasket to limit leakage
- Touch up/paint and monitor ceiling joint for further cracking
- If a return grille: check/replace HVAC filter; consider duct cleaning if heavy debris
- If a bath exhaust: clean fan and verify airflow; clear/repair ducting if weak
