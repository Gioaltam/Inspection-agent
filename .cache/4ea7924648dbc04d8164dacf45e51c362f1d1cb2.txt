Location:
- Exterior side yard; condenser on concrete pad within metal protective cage; adjacent to stucco wall and disconnect box

Observations:
- Ameristar outdoor AC condenser (top-discharge) in a metal cage with overhead bars
- Debris/leaves on unit; vegetation close on left and overhead
- Cage and fasteners show light surface rust/soiling
- Stucco wall behind unit has a visible horizontal crack
- Disconnect present on wall; conduit/whip to unit not visible in photo

Potential Issues:
- Overhead airflow restriction: cage roof bars a few inches above fan discharge
- Debris and nearby vegetation can block coil airflow
- Coil fins appear partially bent/dirty in areas
- Side clearance to wall appears tight (likely <12 in) restricting intake
- Stucco wall crack may allow water intrusion
- Early corrosion on cage hardware/anchors
- Housekeeping/trip hazard from loose debris around pad

Recommendations:
- Provide proper overhead clearance per manufacturer (often 4–6 ft above discharge) or modify/remove cage top; verify side clearances and reposition if needed
- Clean off debris; trim vegetation back 2–3 ft around unit; clean coils and straighten fins
- Seal/repair stucco crack with exterior-grade materials; monitor for moisture
- Treat/rust-proof and repaint corroded cage hardware; check anchors
- HVAC technician: service unit after cleaning, verify airflow/pressures, inspect electrical whip/connections and ensure penetrations/disconnect are properly sealed
