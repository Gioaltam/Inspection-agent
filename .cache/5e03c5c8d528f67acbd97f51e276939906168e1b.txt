Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet, under-sink plumbing

Observations:
- PVC tubular drain with vertical tailpiece and tee to horizontal branch
- Metal sink strainer with rubber gasket and lock ring
- Braided supply lines and flexible metal-sheathed cable/hose at rear
- Cabinet heavily packed with cleaners/plastic bags
- No active drips or water stains visible at time of photo

Potential Issues:
- Sink strainer gasket appears uneven/extruding (gap/separation) — leak risk
- Flexible conduit/hose draped and in contact with drain — abrasion/movement risk
- Crowded storage contacting plumbing — blocked access and potential to stress slip-joint fittings
- No visible dents, cracks, corrosion, or mold noted elsewhere

Recommendations:
- Reseat/tighten sink strainer; replace gasket/apply plumber’s putty as needed; leak test
- Secure/support flexible conduit/hoses; keep clear of piping
- Clear cabinet; maintain clearance around plumbing for inspection and to prevent strain
- Verify proper trap configuration and adequate slope to drain during operation
