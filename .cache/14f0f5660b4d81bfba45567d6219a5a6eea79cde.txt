Location:
- Exterior entry door (top corner near closer), adjacent to brick veneer and storm/screen frame

Observations:
- Painted wood door with small window lite and wood trim/brickmold
- Pneumatic door closer mounted; bracket on jamb, cylinder on door
- Scrape marks and paint loss on door where closer/arm contacted
- Aged/rough paint on brickmold; small chip in paint on jamb trim
- Caulk at window lite trim appears cracked/missing in spots

Potential Issues:
- Paint/finish failure with substrate exposure at scraped areas on door (moisture intrusion risk)
- Gaps/failed caulk around window lite trim; minor gaps at trim/storm-frame joints (air/water entry, pest entry points)
- Evidence of closer misalignment/contact with door surface (rubbing; potential binding and premature wear)

Recommendations:
- Adjust/realign door closer and bracket so arm clears door; verify smooth self-closing and tighten fasteners
- Prep, prime, and repaint damaged door areas; fill and seal any abandoned screw holes
- Re-caulk/seal perimeter of window lite trim and trim-to-frame joints; repaint trim for protection
- Monitor exposed/soft wood; repair/replace any deteriorated sections if found
