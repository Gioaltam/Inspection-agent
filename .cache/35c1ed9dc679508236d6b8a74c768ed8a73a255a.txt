Location:
- Interior ceiling of small room/hall with exhaust fan above doorway (near cabinets/storage)

Observations:
- Textured “popcorn” ceiling, painted
- Extensive peeling/flaking paint and texture
- Exposed brown paper/gypsum in several areas
- Multiple water drip stains/discoloration across ceiling
- Exhaust fan grille dirty and appears slightly loose/misaligned
- Area suggests prior patch/finish differences

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leaks evidenced by stains and drip marks
- Delamination of finish; gaps/voids and substrate exposure
- Possible drywall swelling/warping and weakened surface
- Loose/deteriorated material may fall (minor safety hazard)
- Ventilation likely inadequate near fan; moisture accumulation
- Dark staining consistent with possible mold/mildew development

Recommendations:
- Determine and correct moisture source (roof/plumbing leak or condensation); licensed pro as needed
- Dry and verify low moisture before repairs
- Remove loose/damaged material; repair/replace affected drywall
- Prime with stain-blocking primer; repaint after repairs
- Clean/service or replace exhaust fan; verify ducted to exterior, sealed, and sized correctly; consider humidity control
- If musty odors or >10 sq ft affected, obtain professional mold assessment/remediation
- Before disturbing texture in older homes, test for asbestos (and lead paint if pre-1978) and use proper abatement if present
- Monitor after rain/shower use to confirm issue resolved
