Location:
- Interior ceiling over doorway (small bath/laundry), textured “popcorn” finish with exhaust fan

Observations:
- Popcorn-textured ceiling with multiple large areas of peeling/flaking paint/texture
- Exposed gypsum/substrate visible in several spots
- Brown/gray drip lines and stains across ceiling, concentrated near exhaust fan
- Exhaust fan grille discolored/dirty; appears aged

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leaks indicated by staining and drip patterns
- Failed coating/texture with substrate exposure; risk of falling debris
- Possible mold/mildew from chronic moisture (not confirmed visually)
- Exhaust fan likely underperforming/dirty; potential poor or non-exterior venting
- Possible corrosion on fan grille from moisture
- If original textured ceiling (pre‑1990s), potential asbestos-containing material disturbed

Recommendations:
- Identify and repair moisture source (roof/plumbing above or fan/duct condensation); licensed pro as needed
- Test, clean, and verify exhaust fan is ducted to exterior with proper backdraft damper; replace if deficient
- Dry the area, check for hidden moisture with a meter, and remediate as needed
- Remove loose/damaged material; repair/replace affected drywall; prime with stain-blocking primer and repaint
- Evaluate for microbial growth; remediate if present using proper containment/PPE
- If texture age unknown, have material tested for asbestos prior to disturbance; follow abatement protocol if positive
- Monitor after repairs for any return of staining or peeling
