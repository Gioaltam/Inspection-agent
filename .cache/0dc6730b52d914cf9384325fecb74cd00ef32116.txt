Location:
- Exterior metal door skin near lockset; bottom edge/jamb area visible.

Observations:
- Numerous rust spots with flaking paint on door surface.
- Surface appears pitted in spots; edge shows paint wear.
- Weatherstripping/jamb area shows wear; no major dents visible.
- Lock hardware appears aged/dull.

Potential Issues:
- Rust corrosion with potential perforation eventually (holes/pitting).
- Compromised door skin integrity and potential security risk if perforation advances.
- Degraded weatherseal may allow air/water intrusion.
- Possible moisture source at this location (condensation/leak) contributing to rust.

Recommendations:
- Assess for perforations; if present, consider replacing the door skin or entire door.
- Treat rusted areas with rust converter, prime, and repaint; address all affected spots.
- Replace or re-seal weatherstripping; reseal jamb with appropriate caulk.
- Inspect frame for signs of rot or further corrosion; ensure proper alignment and latch operation.
- Identify and mitigate moisture source to prevent recurrence.
