Location:
- Under-sink cabinet on the plumbing wall.

Observations:
- White PVC P-trap and trap arm connected to wall drain via a rubber Fernco coupling with a clamp.
- Visible shut-off valve (aging) with supply line attached.
- Wall behind/under sink shows staining and grime; rough hole where pipe penetrates wall.
- Floor is dark laminate/vinyl; no visible standing water in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Evidence of past/current water intrusion: wall staining.
- Possible leak at drain connections (P-trap to wall, rubber coupling).
- Aging shut-off valve; potential for failure or leak.
- Unsealed wall penetrations; gaps/voids around pipe entry.
- Possible hidden moisture damage behind wall; potential mold/rot.

Recommendations:
- Perform a leak test; inspect and tighten/replace trap connections; consider replacing rubber coupling with a sealed, code-compliant connection.
- Replace aging shut-off valve with a modern quarter-turn valve and inspect supply line.
- Seal and finish pipe penetrations; install proper escutchels and patch wall as needed.
- Inspect for mold/rot behind wall; remediate if found.
- Verify trap arm slope and overall drainage; correct if drainage is slow or audible gurgling.
