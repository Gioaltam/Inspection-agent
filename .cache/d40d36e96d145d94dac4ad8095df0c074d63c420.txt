Location:
- Bathroom, floor-mounted toilet adjacent to tiled walls

Observations:
- Two-piece toilet set aside/misaligned from drain
- Tank lid missing; temporary plastic cover; tank rim appears chipped/cracked at corner
- Waste flange opening with old wax ring exposed
- Supply line disconnected; angle stop valve present at wall
- Base caulk uneven/missing; staining around base
- Mounting bolt caps missing; side access opening visible on base

Potential Issues:
- Open waste line: sewer gas and pest entry point
- Toilet not secured/misaligned; nonfunctional and trip/fall hazard
- Failed/missing wax ring and base seal; leakage risk to subfloor
- Possible crack/chip at tank rim; potential leak or sudden failure
- Missing tank lid; debris entry and unsafe condition
- Disconnected supply line; valve could release water if opened
- Gaps/failed caulk at base; moisture intrusion pathway
- Staining at base suggests prior water leakage

Recommendations:
- Immediately cap/seal the drain to block sewer gas until repair
- Have a licensed plumber inspect flange; remove old wax, install new closet bolts and wax/rubber seal; properly align, level, and secure toilet
- Reconnect with new braided supply line; test/replace angle stop valve as needed
- Replace damaged tank or entire toilet and install proper tank lid
- After leak test, apply bathroom-grade caulk around base perimeter
- Clean/sanitize area and check surrounding flooring/subfloor for moisture damage; repair if present
- Install bolt caps to finish and protect mounts
