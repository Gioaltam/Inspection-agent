Location:
- Indoor air handler in garage/utility area on concrete floor

Observations:
- Vertical metal AHU on stand; labels intact
- PVC condensate drain with multiple fittings/tee; no clear P-trap or cleanout cap visible
- Refrigerant suction line insulated; insulation torn and taped; gap at cabinet penetration
- Exposed low‑voltage wiring and open splices at base, lying on floor
- Rust/corrosion along lower cabinet, stand, and floor; visible water staining
- Spare 18x20x1 filter stored below; area partly cluttered near unit

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at lower cabinet/stand (active or past moisture damage)
- Water intrusion/leaks indicated by floor staining and rust
- Condensate drain likely improper/missing trap and cleanout; overflow/backup risk
- Gaps/failed sealant at line‑set/penetrations; air leakage and potential condensate formation; possible pest entry
- Refrigerant line insulation damaged/missing in sections; risk of sweating/drips and efficiency loss
- Improper wiring: exposed splices/wires on floor without junction box/conduit; shock/fire and trip hazard
- Restricted service access due to clutter around unit

Recommendations:
- Licensed HVAC technician to inspect system; identify/repair source of moisture; address corrosion and clean cabinet/stand
- Reconfigure condensate drain per manufacturer: add proper P‑trap, slope, and cleanout; flush line; add float safety switch where applicable
- Reseal all cabinet/penetration openings with approved mastic/foam; close pest entry points
- Replace/repair and fully cover refrigerant line insulation; secure and seal at cabinet
- Place all electrical splices in approved junction box; secure wiring off floor and protect with conduit as required
- Clear area to provide safe service clearance; clean and dry floor; monitor for further leaks
- Verify correct air filter is installed and replace as needed; set regular maintenance schedule
