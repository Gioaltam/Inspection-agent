Location:
- Indoor HVAC air handler (floor-mounted utility/garage area)

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with electric heat package labels
- Refrigerant suction line with aging foam insulation and tape repair
- PVC condensate drain with tee; discharge not visible; no obvious P-trap
- Open vertical tee used as vent/cleanout (no cap)
- Rust staining along lower cabinet seam, base stand, and on floor
- Low-voltage wiring splices with wire nuts lying on the floor, unsecured
- Spare 18x20x1 filter resting on condensate piping

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at cabinet base and stand
- Water stains at base/floor indicating prior or active condensate leakage
- No visible condensate P-trap; risk of poor drainage/air draw and overflow
- Open tee on condensate line; potential air loss, splash, and debris entry
- Suction line insulation damaged/gapped; may cause condensation/drip
- Exposed/unsecured low-voltage wiring on floor; vulnerable to damage and trip hazard

Recommendations:
- Have licensed HVAC technician inspect for active leaks; clean/flush condensate system; install proper P-trap and vent per manufacturer; add capped cleanout; verify slope to drain
- Replace/repair suction line insulation; seal penetrations as needed
- Treat/repair rusted cabinet/base; evaluate evaporator drain pan for deterioration
- Secure electrical: place low-voltage splices in approved enclosure or inside unit; elevate/fasten wiring; add conduit/strain relief if needed
- Clean and dry area; monitor for recurring moisture
- Maintain clear service access around the unit and keep items off piping
