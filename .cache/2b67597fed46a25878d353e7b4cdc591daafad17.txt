Location:
- Under kitchen sink; garbage disposal at sink flange

Observations:
- Standard disposal with metal mounting ring/bracket and black plastic housing
- Dishwasher/drain hose connected with worm-gear clamp
- Heavy rust and mineral buildup at sink flange/mounting ring
- Staining/deposits at disposal body seam

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at mounting ring/flange
- Water intrusion/leak evidence (rust/mineral deposits) at flange and possibly disposal seam
- Failed/missing sealant/plumber’s putty at sink flange; potential gaps/voids at interface
- Attachment integrity reduced by corrosion; risk of loosening/failure
- No visible dents, bends, warping, cracks, missing fasteners, improper wiring, mold, or pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber replace corroded sink flange/mounting assembly and gasket; consider replacing the disposal due to corrosion
- Reseat flange with plumber’s putty, tighten mounting, and pressure-test under full sink and dishwasher discharge
- Inspect/replace discharge hose and clamps as needed
- Clean/dry cabinet, monitor for leaks; consider leak detector/drip tray
