Location:
- Exterior face of entry door at lockset/deadbolt

Observations:
- Metal (steel) door slab with Schlage keypad deadbolt and brushed lever handle
- Finish heavily weathered; widespread peeling/chipping paint
- Numerous rusted spots; dust/debris on lock trim
- Door edge near latch shows rough, damaged surface with exposed substrate

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust on metal door surface
- Failed/peeling paint with substrate exposure
- Edge damage with gaps/voids in finish; potential sharp edges
- Potential moisture intrusion through damaged finish

Recommendations:
- Scrape/sand loose paint; treat rust; apply rust-inhibiting primer and repaint with exterior-grade coating
- Repair/fill and seal damaged door edges; ensure all raw metal is sealed
- Consider door slab replacement if corrosion is deep or widespread
- Verify hardware is tight and operates smoothly after repairs; replace weatherstripping if needed
