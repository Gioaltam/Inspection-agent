Location:
- Front yard and front elevation, porch, and carport side

Observations:
- Single-story home; stucco with brick veneer accents; low-slope roof; no gutters visible
- Front porch/canopy with a single slender support post
- Metal security bars on front windows; decorative shutters
- Lawn overgrown with tall grass and weeds; vegetation against façade
- Large trees close to the structure with limbs overhanging roof area
- Driveway/carport at right side

Potential Issues:
- Overgrown vegetation/tall grass: pest harborage and moisture against siding; obscures ground conditions
- Shrubs/plant growth in contact with walls/windows: potential pest entry points
- Tree limbs over roof: abrasion/impact risk and debris accumulation
- Security bars on windows may impede emergency egress if not quick‑release equipped (life-safety)
- Porch canopy shows apparent uneven/sagging line; potential misalignment/insufficient support
- Entry approach lacks a defined walkway and is hidden by tall grass: trip/fall hazard

Recommendations:
- Mow, weed, and clear vegetation at least 6–12 in. from walls; remove debris
- Trim trees back from roof and structure; remove dead/damaged limbs
- Verify window bars have interior quick‑release mechanisms; upgrade or remove if not compliant
- Have a qualified contractor evaluate and repair/shore porch canopy/post as needed
- Install or restore a safe, level walkway to the front door
- Consider adding gutters/downspouts with extensions to divert runoff from foundation
- After clearing, inspect walls/windows and reseal caulk/penetrations as needed
