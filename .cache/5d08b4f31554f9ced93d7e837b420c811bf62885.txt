Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet – underside of sink at drain and adjacent receptacle

Observations:
- Metal sink strainer with metal tailpiece connected to white plastic tubular P-trap via slip-joint nut
- Significant mineral deposits and discoloration on tailpiece; rust/corrosion around strainer locknut
- Duplex receptacle in metal box on cabinet back; flexible metallic conduit present; appliance cord plugged in

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at sink strainer/locknut with substrate exposure
- Water intrusion evidence: mineral deposits and streaking down tailpiece; likely weeping/leak at strainer and/or slip-joint
- Sealant/gasket at drain appears deteriorated/failed
- Slip-joint connection shows staining; potential loose/misaligned joint
- Electrical safety: receptacle located directly below a suspected leak source; no visible GFCI buttons—shock hazard if water contacts outlet

Recommendations:
- Licensed plumber to replace corroded strainer/tailpiece, renew seal (gasket/plumber’s putty), align and tighten slip joints, and leak-test
- Clean and dry cabinet; remove mineral buildup; monitor for moisture and treat any microbial growth if discovered
- Electrician to verify GFCI protection; upgrade to GFCI device or GFCI breaker and consider a drip shield/relocation away from potential leaks
