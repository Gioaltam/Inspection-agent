Location:
- Exterior wall, window beneath vented soffit on blue horizontal siding

Observations:
- Single-hung aluminum window with metal trim/J-channel
- Tinted/reflective glass; lower pane shows peeling film/residue
- No insect screen present
- Blue lap siding with concrete stem wall at base
- Noticeable dirt/mildew staining on lower siding and stem wall
- Vegetation/landscape bed adjacent to foundation

Potential Issues:
- Failed/missing sealant at window perimeter; small gaps at corners/trim
- Unsealed holes/fasteners in siding near window; potential pest/water entry
- Screen missing
- Oxidation/finish wear on aluminum frame
- Mildew/algae growth on lower siding
- Vegetation contacting wall increases moisture/pest risk

Recommendations:
- Re-caulk/seal window-to-trim and trim-to-siding joints; seal any penetrations
- Clean siding and window frame; treat mildew/algae
- Install/replace insect screen
- Trim vegetation back from wall; maintain clearance and drainage away from foundation
- Consider removing/replacing damaged window film or evaluate glazing if clarity is affected
