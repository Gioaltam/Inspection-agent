Location:
- Exterior wall, ground-level window

Observations:
- Horizontal lap siding (painted light blue)
- Aluminum-framed window; dark/tinted glass; no insect screen visible
- Aged/patchy caulk around window perimeter; corner joints visible
- Dirt/mildew staining on lower siding courses
- Small fastener/anchor holes in siding near window
- Vegetation planted close to wall/foundation
- Glass shows residue/scratches/film or paint splatters

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/separations and failed/missing sealant at window perimeter and miter joints — water intrusion/pest entry risk
- Small holes in siding — potential water entry/pest points
- Mildew/algae on siding — moisture retention and surface deterioration over time
- Insect screen missing — pests can enter when window is open
- Minor oxidation/discoloration at aluminum frame; debris in track
- No visible dents, bends, warping, cracks, or substrate exposure

Recommendations:
- Remove and replace exterior caulk around window; seal corner joints; verify weep holes clear
- Patch/seal siding penetrations; replace damaged pieces if they don’t seal properly
- Clean siding; treat for mildew/algae; gentle wash
- Install/repair insect screen
- Clean window/track; address any corrosion; replace failing tint/film if desired
- Maintain vegetation clearance 12–18 in. from wall and foundation
- Monitor interior around window after rains; have contractor evaluate if moisture/drafts noted
