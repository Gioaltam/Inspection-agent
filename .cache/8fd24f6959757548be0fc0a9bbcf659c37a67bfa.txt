Location:
- Basement utility/mechanical closet with a water heater and air-handler return area.

Observations:
- Filter housing at top with pleated filter; frame appears tilted/not flush.
- Rough wooden shelf directly above the equipment.
- Expansion/storage tank (left) tied to CPVC piping feeding the water heater.
- Water heater with multiple CPVC/PEX connections and a T&P valve discharge area.
- Electrical conduit/wiring runs along the right side; some flexible conduit present.
- Closet is tight with limited service clearances; no visible drip pan.

Potential Issues:
- Filter not seated properly; potential airflow restriction and bypass.
- Shelf over equipment; fire/risk if heated components contact wood.
- No visible drip pan or secondary containment under water heater (leak risk).
- T&P discharge line unclear/potentially inadequately routed.
- Exposed wiring/conduits near moisture; possible electrical hazard.
- Ductwork appears dusty/misaligned; potential efficiency and moisture control concerns.

Recommendations:
- Re-seat/replace filter with correct size; ensure full seating and alignment.
- Remove/secure or relocate shelf to maintain proper clearances from equipment.
- Install a proper drip pan under the water heater with a connected drain (per code).
- Verify T&P valve discharge line routing and slope; terminate to safe drainage.
- Secure/organize electrical conduits; ensure water proximity is minimized and meets code.
- Have HVAC tech clean/inspect ductwork; address any leaks or gaps and confirm proper airflow.
