Location:
- Interior ceiling/wall mounted double rectangular HVAC vent grille (two adjacent louvers).

Observations:
- White metal louvers with substantial dust/debris on/between slats.
- No visible rust or water stains around frame; surrounding plaster appears intact.
- Central seam between the two grilles shows dust buildup; no obvious misalignment or loose parts.

Potential Issues:
- Significant dust accumulation on vent blades (air quality and airflow efficiency concern).
- Possible restricted airflow due to dirt buildup in the grille/duct.
- Potential harboring of dust/plethora of pests if not cleaned regularly (not a definite defect, but a maintenance concern).

Recommendations:
- Clean the vent grille and accessible duct interior; vacuum and wipe down slats.
- Inspect and clean/replace HVAC filters; consider a professional duct cleaning if dust persists.
- Verify seals around the vent for airtight connection; reseal if gaps are found.
- Monitor for moisture/mold signs during cleaning; address any moisture issues promptly.
