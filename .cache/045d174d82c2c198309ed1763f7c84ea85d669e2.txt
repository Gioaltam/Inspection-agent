Location:
- Under kitchen sink (base cabinet)

Observations:
- White PVC tubular drain with sanitary tee and horizontal waste arm
- Slip-joint fittings/nuts present; P-trap not visible (obstructed)
- Electrical cords/cables draped along back wall
- Stored items in contact with plumbing
- No visible water stains or corrosion on exposed fittings

Potential Issues:
- Trap not visible—cannot confirm required P-trap or configuration; potential improper setup
- Unsecured/draped cords/cables under sink—subject to moisture and mechanical damage; possible improper wiring/missing support/conduit
- Storage crowding restricts access and can stress fittings

Recommendations:
- Clear cabinet space; keep items off plumbing
- Verify/install proper P-trap and correct alignment/slope; repair as needed
- Securely route cords/cables away from plumbing; have a licensed electrician evaluate and provide proper protection/support and GFCI-protected outlet if not present
- Operate sink and inspect for leaks during a full evaluation
