Location:
- Exterior side yard of a single-story home; green stucco wall with two windows; foundation vents along base; small tree and shrubs near wall.

Observations:
- Lawn shows patchy brown/dry areas and weeds; some bare soil.
- Debris on ground (plastic wrapper/paper).
- Vegetation located close to the wall (tree/shrubs).

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with foundation (moisture/pest ingress risk).
- Dry, stressed lawn; possible irrigation or drainage issue.
- Ground debris could attract pests or indicate poor clearance around wall.

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove vegetation to maintain 12â€“18 inches clearance from the wall.
- Assess irrigation and drainage; reseed or water patches; ensure grading directs water away from foundation.
- Remove debris; perform a basic exterior inspection for any cracks or gaps around windows/vents and seal as needed.
- Verify downspouts/conveyance are present and directed away from the foundation.
