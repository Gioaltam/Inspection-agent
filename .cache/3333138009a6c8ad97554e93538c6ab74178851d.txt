Location:
- Exterior stucco wall at gable end; window area

Observations:
- Textured stucco over masonry/CMU; painted
- Aluminum jalousie (louvered) window; no visible head flashing
- Lap siding and trim above stucco band
- Noticeable discoloration/staining on stucco surface
- Uneven/bulged stucco below window; patched texture
- Hairline and wider cracks, esp. near base/stem wall
- Gaps/voids at window-to-stucco joints; caulk deteriorated/missing

Potential Issues:
- Cracks in stucco may admit water/insects
- Gaps and failed sealant at window perimeter
- No visible drip cap/head flashing above window (leak risk)
- Bulged/irregular stucco suggests prior patch or substrate movement
- Biological growth/staining indicates moisture retention
- Possible settlement crack at lower wall/stem interface
- Jalousie window typically leaks air/water; poor security/efficiency

Recommendations:
- Clean exterior; treat mildew/algae; gentle wash only
- Seal/repair stucco cracks; match finish; repaint after curing
- Re-caulk window perimeter with exterior-grade sealant
- Verify/install proper head flashing/drip edge at window
- Evaluate bulged area and lower crack for movement; repair as needed
- Consider upgrading jalousie window to modern, sealed unit
- Monitor interior for moisture; correct grading/drainage if needed
