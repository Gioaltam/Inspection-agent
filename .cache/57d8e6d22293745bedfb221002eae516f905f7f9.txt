Location:
- Interior ceiling/wall corner above a soffit/trim ledge (exact room unspecified)

Observations:
- Painted gypsum/plaster with orange-peel texture
- Multiple brown drip stains down the wall
- Blistering/bubbling and peeling paint; localized surface spall
- Small areas of substrate exposure
- Minor hairline surface crack near lower portion
- Caulked joint along adjacent trim/soffit

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leak indicated by active-looking stains and paint blisters
- Damaged/softened drywall or plaster; localized warping
- Failed coating and substrate exposure
- Possible mold/mildew behind finish due to prolonged moisture
- Gaps/voids from peeling/loose material

Recommendations:
- Determine and repair moisture source (roof/flashings, plumbing, or HVAC/condensate above); licensed pro as needed
- Check with moisture meter/IR; dry the area thoroughly and monitor for recurrence
- Remove loose/damaged materials; replace any soft or contaminated drywall/plaster
- Clean/treat for microbial growth per professional guidelines; use PPE
- Prime with stain-blocking primer and repaint after moisture content is acceptable (<15%); retexture as needed
- Improve ventilation/insulation in this corner if condensation is contributing
