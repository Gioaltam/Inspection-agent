Location:
- Interior ceiling/wall-mounted exhaust fan grille (likely bathroom)

Observations:
- Painted metal grille with vertical slats; fan blades visible behind
- Heavy dust/lint accumulation on slats and inside fan
- Frame shows chipped paint and surface corrosion spots
- Grille/frame not flush; bent/dented corners
- Gaps/separation visible at perimeter; rough/failed caulk
- Only one fastener visible on right side

Potential Issues:
- Blocked airflow from heavy dust/lint; overheating/fire risk for fan motor
- Corrosion/rust beginning at edges and around fastener
- Misalignment/bent grille; possible loose/missing fasteners
- Gaps/voids at perimeter may allow air leakage and pest entry
- Paint deterioration; substrate exposure in spots

Recommendations:
- Remove grille; vacuum and clean slats, fan housing, and duct connection
- Re-secure grille with proper fasteners; replace if bent or damaged
- Seal perimeter to trim with paintable caulk after alignment
- Treat rust; repaint with rust-inhibiting paint or replace grille
- Test fan airflow; if weak/noisy, have unit and ducting evaluated and cleaned; verify duct terminates outdoors with working backdraft damper
