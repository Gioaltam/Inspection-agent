Location:
- Interior ceiling; louvered HVAC/vent grille

Observations:
- White metal grille set in textured drywall ceiling
- Two screws on right; left side shows empty screw hole and paint scuff
- Grille appears slightly skewed
- Light dust visible on louvers
- No water stains, rust, cracks, or sagging observed

Potential Issues:
- Missing/loose fastener on left; partial separation at edge
- Minor gap/void and misalignment could cause air leakage and rattling
- Dust buildup may reduce airflow/air quality

Recommendations:
- Install/replace missing fastener(s); align grille flush and square
- Seal small perimeter gaps with paintable caulk after securing
- Clean grille and accessible duct boot; maintain regular cleaning/filter changes
- Touch up damaged paint around grille
- Verify adequate airflow; if exhaust, confirm duct terminates outdoors
