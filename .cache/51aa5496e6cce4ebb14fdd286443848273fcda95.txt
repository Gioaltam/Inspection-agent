Location:
- Front exterior of a single-story brick house; entry approach from driveway.

Observations:
- Brick veneer with white trim; metal screen door over interior door; small concrete landing with brick steps.
- Concrete driveway with visible longitudinal crack.
- Window to the right of entry; black trash bin near foundation; small vent/fixture near the door.
- Base of brick wall shows dark staining near soil; grassy/soil strip along foundation.

Potential Issues:
- Driveway crack (trip hazard and potential water entry path).
- Dark staining at base of wall (possible moisture intrusion or efflorescence).
- Soil/grass contact against foundation (moisture/pest risk; potential need for grading clearance).
- No visible exterior handrail on stairs (safety concern for some users).
- Downspouts/drainage not clearly visible (potential drainage issue).

Recommendations:
- Repair or seal driveway crack; consider resurfacing if wide.
- Inspect foundation/stucco/mortar near base; repoint or seal as needed; address staining.
- Regrade soil away from foundation; maintain 4â€“6 inches clearance; ensure proper drainage away from wall.
- Install a handrail on stepped entry if required for safety.
- Verify gutters/downspouts are present and functioning; add splash blocks or extend downspouts if drainage toward foundation is possible.
