Location:
- Exterior, ground-mounted A/C condenser (central air, split system)

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with louvered sides; EnergyGuide 13.0 SEER
- Uses R-410A refrigerant
- Flexible electrical conduit and refrigerant lines enter low on side
- Significant leaf/debris accumulation around base
- Coil fins and intake grille visibly dusty/dirty
- Minor surface rust on cabinet/fasteners
- Small insect/mud nest on cabinet surface

Potential Issues:
- Airflow obstruction from leaves/debris at base
- Dirty condenser coil/fins reducing efficiency/overheating risk
- Surface corrosion on cabinet/fasteners (progressive deterioration risk)
- Insect nest present; potential pest entry to controls
- Minor bent/warped louver sections at lower side

Recommendations:
- Clear all vegetation/leaves; maintain 12â€“24 in. clearance around unit and 6 in. above grade
- Clean condenser coils/fins and grille; straighten bent fins as needed
- Remove insect nest; treat area and install/secure panel gaskets as needed
- Prep and treat rusty areas; repaint with rust-inhibiting coating
- Have HVAC technician service unit and verify electrical/conduit integrity and overall operation
