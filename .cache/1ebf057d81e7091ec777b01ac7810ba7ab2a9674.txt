Location:
- Kitchen counter beneath upper cabinets.

Observations:
- Countertop with multiple small appliances: microwave, toaster, coffee maker, and a plastic bag/items.
- White painted cabinets with dark metal hardware (upper and lower).
- Center-bottom cabinet pair shows misalignment; one door not flush with frame and visible gap.
- Outlet located on backsplash behind appliances; several cords run along the counter.
- No obvious water stains, mold, or corrosion visible.

Potential Issues:
- Dented/loose/misaligned center-bottom cabinet door (possible loose hinge or fasteners).
- Gap between center cabinet doors could indicate wear or frame stress; potential pinch point.
- Cords/plug load near potentially damp area; ensure proper clearance and GFCI protection.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and tighten or replace faulty cabinet hinges/fasteners; realign center-bottom doors to sit flush.
- Check for hidden moisture damage behind misaligned door; repair/replace damaged cabinet if found; reseal edges as needed.
- Declutter counter near outlets; route cords safely and ensure proper GFCI-protected outlets in the kitchen.
