Location:
- Shower floor/pan area (drain visible).

Observations:
- Large areas of coating/finish peeling and flaking.
- Discolored patches; exposed substrate in the peeled zones.
- Surface looks uneven where coating has failed.

Potential Issues:
- Coating failure â†’ potential water intrusion behind the pan/substrate.
- Substrate exposure may lead to mold/mildew risk if moisture persists.
- Slip/fall hazard due to uneven/rough and peeled areas.
- Uncertain waterproofing integrity under the pan.

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed contractor evaluate waterproofing and substrate condition.
- Remove loose coating and recoat or replace with proper waterproof membrane and finish.
- Re-caulk edges where pan meets walls; ensure proper drain seal.
- Consider installing a non-slip surface or texture after repair.
- If moisture/mold is suspected, perform remediation and address any leaks.
