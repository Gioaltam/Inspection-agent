Location:
- Galley kitchen with adjacent utility alcove (electrical panel) at rear

Observations:
- White tile floor; painted drywall; white cabinets with black pulls
- Laminate/solid-surface counters; drop‑in double stainless sink
- Electric smooth-top range; refrigerator present
- Electrical service panel and sub‑meter in alcove; flex metal conduit visible
- No range hood or OTR microwave visible above cooktop
- Minor scuffs/wear on trim and cabinets; grout appears soiled

Potential Issues:
- No visible range hood/vent above cooktop (grease/moisture/heat buildup risk)
- Open/uncovered wall/trim area at base in alcove (gap/void; potential pest entry; exposes utilities)
- Minor cabinet door/drawer misalignment (fit/finish defect)
- No other visible issues

Recommendations:
- Install a proper kitchen exhaust hood or verify compliant mechanical ventilation; follow manufacturer clearance requirements
- Close/repair the alcove wall opening; add a solid cover/trim and seal edges
- Keep required working clearance at electrical panel (min ~30 in wide x 36 in deep); ensure cover is secured and circuits labeled
- Clean and re‑seal grout as needed; touch up paint and adjust cabinet hardware
- Inspect and re‑caulk at sink and counter/backsplash joints where gaps are present to prevent moisture intrusion
