Location:
- Exterior side yard along left side of house (blue siding). Narrow area between primary residence and adjacent white building. HVAC outdoor unit, electrical disconnect, blue tarp-covered pile, and garbage/recycling bins present.

Observations:
- Vinyl siding with typical seams; bottom edge near dirt shows dirt/grime.
- HVAC condenser unit mounted next to wall; electrical disconnect box mounted on wall with cover possibly open.
- Large blue tarp covering a pile on the ground, edges unsecured.
- Two waste/recycling bins behind tarp; some folding chairs leaning nearby.
- Ground is bare dirt with sparse vegetation; no visible drainage or grading visible.
- Adjacent building has a window with some trim, appears to be a window AC or similar opening.

Potential Issues:
- Possible restricted airflow around condenser due to tarp/objects in close proximity (risk of reduced efficiency/overheating).
- Electrical disconnect appears exposed; ensure weatherproof cover is in place and wiring is secured (hazard if open).
- Clutter/storage directly against siding may retain moisture and invite pests; tarp could conceal rot or moisture damage.
- Bare soil near foundation may permit pest intrusion and moisture wicking; no visible physical barrier or grading evident.
- Trip/fall hazard from cluttered narrow side path and unsecured tarp edges.

Recommendations:
- Clear the area around the condenser to maintain minimum 3 feet clearance on all sides; relocate tarp and stored items.
- Verify and secure the electrical disconnect cover; ensure all wiring and connections are weatherproof and up to code.
- Remove or properly store debris and clutter; keep area tidy to reduce moisture retention and pest access.
- Inspect the siding/ground contact area for signs of moisture or rot; repair as needed and ensure proper grading/drainage away from the foundation.
- Consider adding a small weatherproof barrier or gravel/path to improve accessibility and reduce soil exposure near the foundation.
