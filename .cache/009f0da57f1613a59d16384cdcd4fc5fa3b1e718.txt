Location:
- Shower/tub surround wall.

Observations:
- embossed metal-style wall panels covering the wall.
- lower wall area shows a patch with exposed drywall/plaster (beige patch, paper surface visible).
- gaps/seams and possible missing caulk near patch; surrounding paint/finish chipped at door side.
- floor appears dirty; zebra-pattern shower curtain visible.

Potential Issues:
- water intrusion risk behind patched area (exposed substrate).
- potential mold/mildew and rot behind panels due to moisture exposure.
- lack of proper waterproofing around seams; possible failed/absent caulk.
- possible panel loosening or misalignment at seams.
- substrate exposure could lead to further wall deterioration if moisture persists.

Recommendations:
- opens walls at patch to inspect for moisture, rot, and mold; replace damaged drywall as needed.
- install proper waterproofing: cement board or equivalent behind wall, with a water-resistive barrier and sealed joints.
- replace or seal panels with correct waterproof wall system; re-caulk all seams and edges with silicone.
- address ventilation and routine cleaning to reduce moisture buildup.
- repair or replace damaged baseboard/trim; recaulk floor-to-wall transition.
