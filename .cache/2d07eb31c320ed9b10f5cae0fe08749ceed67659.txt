Location:
- Ceiling mounted louvered vent (likely interior exhaust/return) in textured ceiling.

Observations:
- White metal/plastic vent cover with multiple vertical blades; frame appears flush with ceiling.
- Visible screws on frame; some dust/dirt on blades and bottom edge.
- Hairline vertical crack extending downward from area near vent.

Potential Issues:
- Vertical crack in ceiling/plaster near vent (potential settlement or moisture-related issue).
- Dirt/dust buildup on vent blades (possible mold risk if moisture is present).

Recommendations:
- Monitor crack for progression; if it widens or shows staining, have a moisture/structural assessment done.
- Inspect for any hidden leaks above ceiling; repair as needed and patch/repaint.
- Clean vent blades and interior; verify proper exhaust operation and seal around duct if applicable.
