Location:
- Interior of kitchen/laundry cabinet area, back wall near plumbing.

Observations:
- White PVC drain pipe with slip joint and a horizontal run; grey PVC/FD flange style coupling.
- Beige/cream plastic pipe running horizontally across back of cabinet.
- Black flexible supply line with attached valve at top left.
- Brown staining along the vertical back seam behind the drain/supply area.
- Cabinet back surface shows discoloration; screws securing panels are present.

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leaks indicated by brown staining (possible past or active leak).
- Possible moisture exposure behind the panel (risk of mold/rot).
- Gap/seal around pipe pass-through with staining suggesting lack of proper sealing.
- Potential behind-wall corrosion or mineral buildup from moisture.

Recommendations:
- Monitor for active leaks: run faucets/toilets and inspect connections for moisture.
- Seal pipe penetrations and any gaps with appropriate caulk/backer rod where visible.
- If stain persists or you observe moisture, have a plumber inspect supply/drain connections and behind-wall area.
- Consider inspecting for mold and addressing any rot if found; replace damaged cabinet backing if needed.
