Location:
- Interior ceiling â€“ large return-air grille (exact room unclear)

Observations:
- Rectangular metal louvered grille
- Noticeable dark dust/soiling on louvers
- Surrounding ceiling appears intact; details limited due to motion blur

Potential Issues:
- Heavy dust buildup likely restricting airflow and degrading indoor air quality; may indicate overdue/missing return filter

Recommendations:
- Vacuum/clean grille and surrounding area
- Replace/upgrade return filter (correct size, proper seal); verify filter rack/door gasket is intact
- If airflow remains weak or dust rapidly returns, have HVAC tech inspect return plenum/ducts for leaks and overall system performance
- Establish regular filter changes and grille cleaning schedule
