Location:
- Exterior; ground-mounted condenser adjacent to siding

Observations:
- Tempstar outdoor A/C condensing unit
- Metal shroud with top fan guard; vertical wire coil guard
- Coil fins appear dirty with debris; some localized flattened areas
- Top fan guard visibly bent/warped at edge
- Minor surface rust noted at guard area; small vegetation/debris on top

Potential Issues:
- Bent/warped top fan guard; potential contact/clearance issue with fan
- Dirty/clogged condenser fins; reduced airflow/efficiency risk
- Localized fin damage (flattened/compressed)
- Minor corrosion forming on guard/fastener

Recommendations:
- Clean condenser coils and housing; remove debris/vegetation
- Comb/straighten damaged fins; repair/replace sections if crushed
- Straighten or replace bent top fan guard; confirm safe fan clearance
- Treat/paint rusted areas to inhibit further corrosion
- Have HVAC technician service unit and verify proper operation after cleaning/repairs
