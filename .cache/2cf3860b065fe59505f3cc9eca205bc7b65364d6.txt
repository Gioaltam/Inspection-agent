Location:
- Exterior, ground-mounted AC condenser adjacent to siding

Observations:
- Tempstar outdoor condensing unit with metal coil-guard grille
- Top fan guard/grille visibly bent/deformed; small rust spot at edge
- Coil fins dirty with lint/plant debris; localized fin flattening
- Debris accumulation along top perimeter under cap
- Appears limited clearance to wall

Potential Issues:
- Bends/deformation at top fan guard; reduced protection/possible fan interference
- Corrosion/rust starting on fan guard
- Blocked/dirty condenser fins; restricted airflow/efficiency; overheating risk
- Bent/flattened fins; airflow restriction
- Possible inadequate clearance to wall, impeding airflow/service access

Recommendations:
- Clean coils and remove all debris from and around unit; maintain 12â€“24 in clearance on all sides
- Straighten fins with fin comb; replace damaged sections if needed
- Treat rusted areas (clean/prime/paint) or replace fan guard if weakened
- HVAC technician to service unit and verify proper operation, clearances, and that fan guard is secure and not contacting blades
