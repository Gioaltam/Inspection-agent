Location:
- Exterior window on a stucco wall, appears to be a first-floor/window opening.

Observations:
- Wood sash/frame with white paint; noticeable peeling/chipping at jambs and sill.
- Gaps/voids around trim joints; paint consistency uneven.
- Sill/low frame area shows weathering; glass has surface dirt and specks; muntin/grid pattern visible.

Potential Issues:
- Peeling paint with exposed wood → potential wood rot.
- Gaps in caulk around frame → potential water intrusion.
- Deteriorated sill trim → possible moisture exposure at exterior joint.

Recommendations:
- Scrape and repaint trim; repair any rotten wood as needed.
- Recaulk around window perimeter to seal gaps; ensure proper flashing.
- Inspect sill for rot and replace/repair if compromised.
- Clean exterior glass; evaluate interior for any signs of water intrusion after rain.
