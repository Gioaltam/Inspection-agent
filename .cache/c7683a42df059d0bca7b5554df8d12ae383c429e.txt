Location:
- Exterior storefront window at street level (front of house), adjacent to brick walkway.

Observations:
- Vertical blinds behind window; left panel appears weathered/dim.
- A loose metal cord/wire resting on the window sill and across the base of the window.
- Window sill and base show dirt staining; caulk along the bottom track appears aged with small gaps.
- No visible active water staining inside the photo; exterior surface generally intact.

Potential Issues:
- Loose blind cord/wire poses trip/snaring hazard and may affect window operation.
- Aged/unglued caulk with gaps may allow water intrusion and potential mold/moisture behind sill.
- Dirt staining suggests moisture exposure; could indicate underlying condensation issues.

Recommendations:
- Secure or remove the loose cord; ensure blinds are properly installed or replace as needed.
- Re-caulk/seal bottom perimeter of the window; clean/repair sill to maintain drainage and prevent leaks.
- Inspect interior for any signs of moisture, mold, or rot; address if found.
- If any glazing cracks or pane damage is suspected, have a window-glazing professional evaluate and repair.
