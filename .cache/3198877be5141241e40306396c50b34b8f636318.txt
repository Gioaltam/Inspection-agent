Location:
- Under kitchen sink/base cabinet

Observations:
- Double-bowl sink with tubular PVC/ABS drain assembly and P-trap
- Baffle tee under left bowl; horizontal waste arm to right
- Air admittance valve (AAV) on vertical stub
- Multiple slip-joint connections with plastic compression nuts
- Stainless braided water supply lines present
- Gray sink strainer body with old putty/sealant residue

Potential Issues:
- Mineral/brown staining on several slip-joint nuts and at strainer underside → evidence of past/possible active leaks
- Irregular/deteriorated sealant at strainer connection → possible failed seal
- Water stain on cabinet base panel (left side)
- Some slip-joint connections appear slightly out-of-square/misaligned, increasing leak risk
- No visible cracks, gaps/voids in pipe walls; no corrosion/rust on plastic; no mold/rot observed; no missing parts/fasteners noted; no improper wiring or conduit issues visible

Recommendations:
- Run water and inspect all joints for active drips; tighten/realign or replace slip-joint washers/trap components as needed
- Reseat/replace sink strainer with fresh plumber’s putty; replace strainer if corroded
- Clean and dry cabinet; monitor for new moisture; consider a protective mat
- Verify AAV is vertical, accessible, and at least 4 in above trap arm; replace if odors/drainage issues occur
