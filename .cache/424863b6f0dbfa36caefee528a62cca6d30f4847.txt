Location:
- Photo of a “Rental Home Inspection Checklist” with handwritten notes (Portuguese)

Observations:
- Notes list: tall grass; liquid/broken pipe next to the door; roof leak; HVAC filter “16x20” replaced; A/C problem
- Conditions are reported by notes; property areas not visible

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leaks: roof leak reported; liquid from broken pipe near entry
- Slip/trip hazard: wet area at doorway from leaking/broken pipe
- Moisture damage and mold risk from leaks
- HVAC malfunction affecting cooling/air quality
- Overgrown grass: sanitation/pest harborage and possible code/HOA concern

Recommendations:
- Plumber to repair/replace broken pipe by door; seal any wall/threshold penetrations; dry and inspect adjacent materials
- Roofing contractor to locate and repair roof leak; check attic/ceilings for stains, rot, or mold; replace/seal materials as needed
- HVAC tech to diagnose A/C issue; verify correct 16x20 filter size and replace; check condensate drain
- Mow/trim vegetation; remove debris; monitor for pests
- Reinspect after repairs and document findings
