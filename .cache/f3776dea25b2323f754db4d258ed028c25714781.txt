Location:
- Side yard adjacent to blue siding house; small deck/platform area.

Observations:
- Large outdoor grill/smoker on a weathered wooden platform with metal mesh cages and miscellaneous items (cones, bags).
- Weeds and vegetation growing around and through the deck edges; clutter stored on platform.
- Siding near the eave shows peeling paint; visible edge trim/soffit with some wear.
- Metal frame/hitch components on the ground with some rust.

Potential Issues:
- Deteriorated/deck boards and possible wood rot; structural risk.
- Rusting metal components; potential failure or safety hazard.
- Vegetation encroachment and gaps allowing moisture/pest entry.
- Peeling/failed paint on siding; potential moisture intrusion into wood.
- Items stored directly on deck close to house; potential fire risk near siding/grill.
- Trip/fall hazards from clutter and uneven deck surface.

Recommendations:
- Clear and organize area; remove unnecessary items; relocate grill away from siding.
- Inspect deck for soft spots; replace damaged boards; tighten/replace fasteners; seal/coat to protect.
- Treat or replace severely rusted metal parts; repaint and ensure secure mounting.
- Trim vegetation; ensure 12â€“18 inches clearance from siding and proper drainage.
- Repaint/caulk peeling siding; address any moisture-prone gaps around soffits/drip edge.
- Consider a dedicated grill pad or enclosure away from structures and a safer storage solution for ambient items.
