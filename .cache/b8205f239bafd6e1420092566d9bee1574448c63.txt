Location:
- Ceiling mounted air return grille (two-section) in interior room.

Observations:
- Rectangular metal grille with vertical slats.
- Dirt/dust visible on and behind the grille.
- Cracks in the ceiling surface just above the grille.
- Small gap between grille edge and ceiling on the left side.

Potential Issues:
- Ceiling crack: possible structural movement or moisture intrusion.
- Gaps around grille: potential air leakage and pest ingress.
- Dust buildup: reduced airflow; potential mold risk if damp.

Recommendations:
- Inspect above ceiling for moisture leaks; repair crack and reseal around grille.
- Clean grille; reseal gaps with appropriate caulk or gasket material.
- Monitor for moisture or mold; address if signs appear. Consider HVAC/duct cleaning if buildup persists.
