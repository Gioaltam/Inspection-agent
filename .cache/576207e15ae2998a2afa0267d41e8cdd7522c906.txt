Location:
- Interior ceiling/wloor mounted rectangular metal HVAC vent grille; flush mounted in white painted surface.

Observations:
- Framed grate with visible mounting screws on left and right.
- Surface is textured plaster/drywall with paint.
- Minor paint cracking/chipping and a small gap/seam at bottom edge around frame.
- No visible stains, rust, mold, or water marks.

Potential Issues:
- Gap/void between vent frame and wall at bottom edge (air leakage/pest entry risk).
- Chipped/peeling paint around frame (minor substrate exposure risk over time).
- No obvious loose fasteners, but verify securement.

Recommendations:
- Re-seal gap with paintable caulk and touch up paint to improve seal.
- Inspect for moisture or past water intrusion; repair if any stains found.
- Ensure screws remain tight and vent is securely mounted; tighten if needed.
- Clean vent to maintain airflow.
