Location:
- Exterior side/back yard along house wall next to wood privacy fence

Observations:
- Dense overgrown grass/weeds; vegetation contacting siding and fence
- Mature tree at fence line; vines/low branches present
- Fallen sticks/yard debris on ground
- Horizontal lap siding; foundation/grade largely obscured
- Weathered wood fence; sections obscured by growth

Potential Issues:
- Overgrown vegetation against structure/fence—moisture retention and pest harborage
- Trip/fall hazard from tall grass hiding ground and fallen branches
- Blocked access to wall/foundation for inspection and maintenance
- Possible pest entry paths at foundation due to brush contact

Recommendations:
- Mow and remove weeds/brush; maintain 6–12 in clearance from siding/fence
- Remove fallen branches/debris to reduce trip hazard
- Trim tree and vines away from fence and structure
- After clearing, inspect siding, fence, and foundation for rot, gaps, soil contact; repair/caulk/paint as needed
- Consider pest control inspection/treatment after vegetation removal
