Location:
- Interior side of exterior/service door and jamb

Observations:
- Panel door with knob lock; metal/wood jamb and threshold
- Heavy surface grime/discoloration on door and frame
- Daylight visible along latch side and bottom edge
- Weatherstripping/sweep appears missing or ineffective
- Strike plate area on jamb appears empty/damaged; paint chipped
- Paint peeling/flaking on jamb; bare substrate visible
- Surface oxidation visible on metal areas

Potential Issues:
- Significant gaps/voids at side and bottom; potential air/water intrusion and pest entry
- Door/jamb misalignment or door warp (uneven reveal; latch side gap)
- Missing/loose strike plate; reduced security and latch engagement
- Failed/missing weatherstripping and door sweep
- Peeling paint with substrate exposure; localized surface rust/corrosion
- Staining and possible mildew-like growth on surfaces
- Cracked/damaged jamb at latch area

Recommendations:
- Adjust/realign door and hinges to achieve uniform reveal and proper latch
- Install/replace weatherstripping and a door sweep; ensure tight seal at threshold
- Install/secure correct strike plate and hardware; repair or reinforce latch-side jamb
- Clean surfaces; treat rust; prime and repaint exposed areas
- Seal/caulk perimeter of frame as needed to prevent drafts/moisture
- If staining persists or moisture is present, evaluate for water source and remediate; consider door/jamb replacement if repairs are not feasible
