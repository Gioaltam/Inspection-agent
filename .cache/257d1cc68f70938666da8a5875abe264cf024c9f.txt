Location:
- Interior side of exterior door and metal jamb/threshold

Observations:
- Painted metal/steel door with brass knob; metal frame
- Heavy surface grime/discoloration on door
- Daylight visible along latch side and at bottom threshold
- Weatherstripping/sweep appears missing/worn; threshold gap present
- Paint peeling/chipping on jamb; rust spots visible on metal
- Uneven reveal at latch side indicates misalignment
- Strike/latch area of jamb scuffed with open screw holes

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at jamb and sill allowing air/water intrusion and pest entry
- Door misalignment/possible warp causing poor seal and security concerns
- Failed/missing weatherstripping and door sweep
- Paint failure with substrate exposure and corrosion/rust on metal frame
- Visible staining/soiling on door; possible moisture-related microbial growth (not confirmed)

Recommendations:
- Adjust/re-hang door and hinges; correct alignment and latch engagement
- Install new perimeter weatherstripping and door sweep; adjust/replace threshold
- Clean and sanitize door surfaces; if odors or recurring staining, evaluate for moisture/microbial growth
- Remove rust, prime, and repaint metal frame/door; seal joints with exterior-grade caulk
- Repair/replace strike plate or damaged latch area; secure any missing fasteners
- Monitor after rains for leaks; seal any remaining gaps to deter pests
