Location:
- Front exterior porch area; two adjacent basement-style windows on blue vinyl siding.

Observations:
- Left window: appears intact with black aluminum frame.
- Right window: damaged/face of pane or sash appears broken or missing; interior shading or covering torn; overall window appears non-functional or weatherproofing compromised.
- Siding trim between windows shows typical wear; minor gaps at window area.
- No visible mold, rot, or active water staining in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Broken/missing window pane on right window (safety and weather intrusion risk).
- Likely compromised sealant/caulk around right window (energy/water intrusion risk).
- Potential pest entry point through damaged window opening.
- Possible minor framing/sill exposure due to damage; needs closer inspection.

Recommendations:
- Replace or repair the right window with proper flashing and exterior caulk/sealant.
- Re-seal window per manufacturer specs; inspect surrounding framing for moisture damage and repair as needed.
- Consider installing a storm window or replacing with a new energy-efficient unit.
- Clean/secure any loose exterior trim and verify operation of both windows.
