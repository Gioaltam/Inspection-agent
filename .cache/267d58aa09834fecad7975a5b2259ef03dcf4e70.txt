Observations:
- Handwritten items in Portuguese: “canos/cano quebrado ao lado da porta” (broken pipe near the door); “vazamento do telhado” (roof leak); “filtro trancado” (filter blocked); “problema c/ A/C” (AC problem); “16 x 20” (dimension).

Potential Issues:
- Broken pipe near the door: potential water intrusion.
- Roof leak: risk of water intrusion, structural damage, mold.
- A/C problem: HVAC malfunction or inefficiency; potential electrical/refrigerant concerns.
- Blocked/dirty filter: airflow restriction, HVAC strain, indoor air quality concerns.

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber inspect and repair the broken pipe; check for leaks and proper sealing.
- Schedule roof inspection and repair; check for signs of water intrusion in attic/ceiling and address mold if found.
- Have HVAC technician diagnose and repair the A/C issue; replace/clean filter; verify refrigerant and electrical connections.
- If any water intrusion is found, perform a moisture/mold assessment and address ventilation around the area.
