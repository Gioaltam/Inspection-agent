Location:
- Interior â€“ HVAC return/supply grille (metal louvered)

Observations:
- Painted metal grille; horizontal louvers
- Noticeable dust/lint and cobweb buildup on and behind louvers
- Minor paint drips/splatter; small rust specks on right side
- No broken louvers observed

Potential Issues:
- Dust/debris accumulation may restrict airflow and degrade indoor air quality
- Early corrosion spots on grille surface
- No visible dents, bends, warping, cracks, gaps/separations, loose/missing fasteners, misalignment, failed caulk, substrate exposure, water stains/leaks, mold/mildew/rot, improper wiring, blocked/unsafe conditions, trip hazards, or pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Clean grille (vacuum/brush and wipe); remove cobwebs
- Replace/clean HVAC filter; consider duct cleaning if buildup persists
- Treat rust: sand, prime, repaint to prevent further corrosion
- Check perimeter for gaps; seal if found
- Monitor for excess humidity/condensation contributing to corrosion
