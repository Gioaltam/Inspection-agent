Location: Floor vent cover near wall

What I See:
- Metal vent cover with a bent/dented corner and chipped paint.
- Light surface rust on slats and screws; visible dust/debris in the duct.

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged corner of the vent cover with finish failure.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the vent cover with a same-size rust-resistant model; use stainless/coated screws.
- While the cover is off, vacuum the duct opening.
- Ensure the new cover sits flush with the floor and has no sharp edges.
