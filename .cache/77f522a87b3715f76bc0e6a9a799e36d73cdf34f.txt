Location: Floor supply vent

What I See: Metal register with visible rust and a bent/damaged corner; paint is flaking.

Issues to Address:
- Corroded/grimy grille and screws
- Bent corner creating a sharp edge and poor fit

Recommended Action:
- Replace the floor register with a new, rustâ€‘resistant model of the same size. Secure with new screws so it sits flush.
- While the register is off, vacuum the duct opening to remove debris.
