Location:
- Exterior HVAC condenser area (behind dense grasses) near the foundation/wall. PVC drain line and electrical conduit/piping visible along the ground wall.

Observations:
- Dense tall grasses/weeds growing directly against the condenser and along the base.
- White PVC/drain line lying across the ground area in front of the unit.
- Unit grille/coil area partially obscured by vegetation.
- Hand bringing attention to the ground/vegetation; no obvious structural damage visible.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with the condenser can restrict airflow and cause overheating/low efficiency.
- Debris and moisture accumulation around the base may promote corrosion, rust, or mold growth.
- Pest ingress potential due to overgrowth and gaps around the equipment.
- PVC drain line not secured and potentially susceptible to damage or leaks.
- Electrical conduit/piping near vegetation may be at risk if vegetation is allowed to grow into it or if clamps are loose (not clearly visible).

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove surrounding vegetation to maintain at least 24 inches of clearance on all sides of the condenser.
- Remove weeds and keep base clean; consider a clean gravel/mulch barrier to reduce moisture retention.
- Secure and route PVC drain line properly; inspect for leaks and ensure it is clamped/supports are in place.
- Have a licensed HVAC tech inspect coil cleanliness, unit airflow, and overall condition; address any signs of corrosion or damage.
- Check electrical/line-set connections for proper protection and mounting; service as needed.
