Location:
- Interior wall-to-ceiling junction above/near a door or window trim

Observations:
- Painted drywall ceiling (smooth) meeting textured drywall wall
- Linear joint shows previous caulk/patch along entire length
- Noticeable open seam; caulk brittle and peeling; gap up to roughly 1/8 in
- Minor waviness/misalignment at the joint

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids/separations along ceiling-wall joint
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk
- Hairline cracking at joint; possible inadequate taping or movement
- Potential minor pest/draft/energy-loss pathway
- No visible water intrusion/stains, mold/mildew, rust, or exposed wiring

Recommendations:
- Remove deteriorated caulk; properly tape/mud the joint as needed; apply flexible paintable caulk; repaint
- Monitor for recurring separation; if it widens, have a drywall/framing contractor evaluate for movement or loose corner bead
- Keep indoor humidity stable to reduce seasonal expansion/contraction
- If future staining appears, investigate attic/roof for leaks immediately
