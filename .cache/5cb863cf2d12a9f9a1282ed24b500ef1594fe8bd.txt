Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (kitchen/bath vanity)

Observations:
- White plastic P-trap with slip-joint fittings
- Drain enters wall; large, rough opening around pipe; hose clamp visible at stub-out
- Gray flexible supply line; metal escutcheon/fastener present
- Rust visible on escutcheon and screw
- Brown stains on cabinet base and back wall; debris present
- Dark spotting along rear-bottom seam of cabinet panel

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids around drain penetration into wall (pest/odor entry, air leakage)
- Corrosion/rust on escutcheon/fastener
- Water stains indicate possible prior/active leak at trap or connections
- Possible mold/mildew at rear-bottom seam
- Cabinet base/particleboard shows moisture staining and beginning deterioration
- Missing/failed sealant at wall and cabinet penetrations

Recommendations:
- Run fixture and inspect for leaks; tighten/repair/replace trap and connections as needed
- Replace corroded escutcheon/fastener; verify supply line and shutoff are sound
- Seal wall penetrations with proper escutcheons and caulk/foam
- Clean and disinfect interior; remove debris
- Dry area; repair/replace damaged cabinet materials; treat mold-affected surfaces
- Monitor after repairs for moisture (consider leak alarm/pan)
