Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (interior back wall/plumbing area)

Observations:
- CPVC supply lines, braided stainless supply hose, PVC drain with pipe hangers
- Pronounced brown/white vertical staining/mineral deposits on cabinet back panel under supply fittings
- Particleboard/backing shows discoloration and localized swelling; rough/unfinished cutouts around piping
- Small crack visible in panel surface near lower CPVC line

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leak evidence at upper supply connection/CPVC joint (stains/mineral deposits)
- Possible mold/mildew growth on cabinet panel along stain path
- Panel damage: swelling/warping and surface crack in particleboard
- Unsealed gaps around pipe penetrations; exposed substrate susceptible to further moisture damage and pest entry

Recommendations:
- Identify and repair leak source at faucet supply/CPVC connections; replace/tighten components as needed
- Dry area thoroughly; clean/disinfect stained surfaces; monitor for further moisture
- Replace damaged cabinet panel if softened or mold persists
- Seal pipe penetrations/edges (appropriate caulk/escutcheons) to protect substrate and deter pests
- Consider a leak tray or water sensor under sink for early detection
