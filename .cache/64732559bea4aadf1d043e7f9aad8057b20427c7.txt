Location:
- Backyard area adjacent to a raised deck; foundation siding visible; chain-link fence in background.

Observations:
- Dense, tall grasses/weeds encroaching along the foundation and under the deck.
- Deck edge and stairs show weathered, peeling paint with exposed wood; boards appear aged.
- Ground surface near the deck is bare soil with minimal ground cover.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with structure can trap moisture and attract pests.
- Wood decking in contact with soil/ground with peeling finish; potential rot or structural weakening.
- Possible trip/fall hazard from overgrown grass and uneven deck/step surfaces.

Recommendations:
- Trim back and maintain vegetation at least 12 inches from siding/deck; keep area clear.
- Inspect deck boards and framing for rot, loose fasteners, or damage; replace/repair as needed; reseal/paint to protect wood.
- Create a moisture barrier between soil and deck (gravel or paving) and ensure proper drainage.
- Regularly monitor for signs of pest activity or water intrusion; address promptly.
