Location:
- Ceiling vent register (louvered) in interior ceiling.

Observations:
- White metal louvers; surrounding plaster/paint is textured.
- Cracking and peeling plaster around the vent frame.
- Small gaps between vent frame and ceiling; screws visible.
- Dust/dirt buildup on louvers; dark debris along bottom slats.
- Possible minor stain/darker band at lower edge of image.

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/peeling plaster near vent (possible moisture or movement).
- Gaps around frame with no evident sealant (air/moisture intrusion risk).
- Dirt accumulation; potential mold risk if humidity/moisture is present.
- Substrate exposure where plaster is cracked.

Recommendations:
- Inspect for moisture source above ceiling (leak from roof/plumbing) and repair.
- Patch cracked plaster; reseal vent perimeter with appropriate caulk/sealant; repaint as needed.
- Clean or replace vent grille; ensure ductwork is sealed to exterior and free of obstructions.
- If moisture/mold suspected or stains present, perform moisture assessment and remediation as needed.
