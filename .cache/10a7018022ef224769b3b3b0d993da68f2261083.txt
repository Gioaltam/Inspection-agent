- Location: Side/rear yard adjacent to stucco exterior wall and chain-link fence.
- Exterior wall: Stucco siding; no visible cracks or damage from this angle.
- Ground/grading: Patchy lawn with dry brown areas; potential moisture retention near foundation.
- Vegetation: Tall grasses and a large tree very close to the wall; may affect wall/roof clearance and pest access.
- Fence/related: Chain-link fence appears intact but metal posts show weathering; keep vegetation from growing into fence line.
- Recommendations: Trim vegetation away from siding; maintain 12â€“24 inches clearance; ensure grading slopes away from foundation; verify downspouts direct water away from the wall.
