Location:
- Entry door (interior view) with keypad deadbolt and lever handle

Observations:
- Metal/steel door; numerous areas of blistered and flaking paint
- Exposed bare metal with scattered surface rust/pitting
- Brushed-nickel keypad deadbolt and lever appear recently installed
- Door is ajar; strike/hinges not visible

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust on door skin; paint failure with substrate exposure
- Peeling/chipping paint; possible sharp edges
- Localized pitting/gouges near hardware; potential weakening around lock area
- No obvious dents, bends, cracks, loose parts, or misalignment visible from this angle

Recommendations:
- Scrape/sand, treat rust (converter), prime with rust-inhibiting metal primer, and repaint all sides/edges
- If corrosion is deep or door skin is compromised, have a door/locksmith pro evaluate; replace if needed
- Test keypad and key operation; clean/lubricate hardware and replace batteries as needed
- If home predates 1978, consider lead-paint testing and use lead-safe practices when repairing
- Maintain exterior protection (paint/caulk/weatherstripping) to limit future moisture-related corrosion
