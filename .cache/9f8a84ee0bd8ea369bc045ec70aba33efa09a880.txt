Location:
- Exterior window set on a beige stucco wall (two-pane aluminum frame with internal vertical blinds).

Observations:
- Metal window frame with mullion between the two sash sections.
- Perimeter around the frame shows some sealant/caulk wear; joints appear slightly gapful.
- Stucco at/near the base shows minor cracking and surface chipping; small patch area visible.
- A small gap/void at the bottom section of the right sash area.
- Exterior outlet on the stucco beneath window; appears without a weatherproof cover.
- Glass has light scratches/scuffs; no obvious condensation or staining visible from this plane.

Potential Issues:
- Degraded or missing caulk/sealant at window perimeters (water intrusion risk).
- Cracked/chipped stucco at the base (moisture intrusion and cosmetic concern).
- Gap at bottom of right sash (air/water ingress potential).
- Exterior electrical outlet lacking weatherproof cover (electrical safety hazard).

Recommendations:
- Re-caulk/seal window perimeter with exterior-grade sealant; ensure proper flashing to divert water.
- Patch and repaint/texture cracked stucco; monitor for further cracking or moisture intrusion.
- Seal or adjust bottom sash gap; verify frame alignment and secure fasteners as needed.
- Install a proper weatherproof cover for the exterior outlet (GFCI if required); test for operation and safety.
