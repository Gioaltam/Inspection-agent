Location:
- Exterior balcony/patio window and sill

Observations:
- Aluminum sliding window with insect screen; precast/stone sill; metal guard/rail in front
- Visible butt joint in lower window frame/trim at center
- Dirt/debris in window track and on sill
- Screen frame appears bowed/not seated evenly along bottom
- No visible cracks in glass

Potential Issues:
- Gap/separation at lower frame/trim joint (open joint)
- Screen frame misaligned/warped; likely loose fit
- Debris accumulation in track may obstruct drainage/weep paths and hold moisture
- Surface staining/possible biological growth on sill/deck adjacent to window
- Potential pest entry at screen/frame gaps

Recommendations:
- Clean window track and sill; clear any weep holes for proper drainage
- Repair or replace separated lower frame/trim piece; seal joint with appropriate exterior sealant
- Adjust/repair or replace insect screen frame and spline for tight fit
- Clean and treat stained areas for mildew/algae; maintain regular cleaning
- Monitor during rainfall; if leakage observed, have a window contractor evaluate for further repairs
