Location:
- Cabinet/utility area floor (near small pump with tubing)

Observations:
- White plastic pump/reservoir with clear vinyl hose; yellow/black wires draped
- Tile/laminate floor panels with visible seams
- Dark wet patches and puddling on floor
- Heavy orange/brown staining and mineral residue
- Corrosion visible at base of vertical metal pipe
- Debris and plastic wrapper on floor

Potential Issues:
- Active water intrusion/leak evident (standing moisture and fresh stains)
- Corrosion/rust at pipe base and on surfaces
- Possible mold/mildew from chronic moisture
- Wiring lying in damp area; not protected; potential shock/short risk
- Gaps at panel seams may allow water penetration and hidden rot

Recommendations:
- Locate and repair leak immediately (inspect pump, tubing, fittings, and nearby plumbing drain)
- Service/replace condensate pump and hoses; secure connections; route to proper drain with air gap
- Dry area thoroughly; clean/disinfect; remove residue; monitor for recurrence
- Evaluate/repair any water-damaged materials; address corroded pipe as needed; apply rust-inhibiting treatment
- Elevate/secure wiring away from moisture; use proper clips/conduit and GFCI-protected receptacle
- Seal floor seams/gaps; consider a drip pan or leak alarm
- Remove debris and keep area clear for inspection and service
