Location:
- Mechanical/storage area floor near a condensate pump

Observations:
- White condensate pump with clear vinyl discharge tube and lowâ€‘voltage wires
- Metal floor/pan with heavy rusting and widespread water staining; damp areas visible
- Corroded vertical pipe at base/penetration
- Debris/mineral deposits on floor; dark discoloration on adjacent surfaces
- Visible seam/penetration in pan around piping

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leak likely from condensate pump/tubing or nearby plumbing (active moisture present)
- Corrosion/rust on metal pan and pipe; potential weakening and future leakage
- Possible microbial growth due to prolonged moisture
- Gaps/voids at floor pan seams/penetrations; potential pathway for water migration and pests
- Unsecured wiring to pump presents snag/strain risk

Recommendations:
- Diagnose and repair leak source: test/clean/replace condensate pump and tubing; verify discharge line is clear and connections are tight and sloped
- Thoroughly dry area; clean and disinfect surfaces; remove debris
- Treat or replace corroded pan; apply rust inhibitor/waterproof coating as needed
- Seal penetrations/seams around piping with appropriate sealant
- Inspect corroded pipe for damage; repair/replace and protect against future corrosion
- Secure wiring/cables; ensure pump is properly powered and grounded
- Monitor area after repairs for recurring moisture
