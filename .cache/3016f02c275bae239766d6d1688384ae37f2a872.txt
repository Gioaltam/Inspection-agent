- Exterior finish: painted stucco wall (green) with white vinyl window trim; no visible cracks from this distance.
- Foundation/ventilation: crawlspace vents along base of wall; ensure vents remain unobstructed by vegetation or debris.
- Landscaping: shrubs and small tree very close to wall (within 2â€“3 ft); maintain clearance to reduce moisture/pest intrusion.
- Ground debris: litter (plastic bag, paper) on lawn; remove to prevent pest habitat.
- Drainage: gutters/downspouts not clearly visible; confirm presence and that downspouts discharge away from foundation.
