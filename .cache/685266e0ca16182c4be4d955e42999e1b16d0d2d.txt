Location:
- Exterior first-floor window set in stucco wall.

Observations:
- White framed double-hung/sliding window with blinds; sticker on upper sash.
- White window sill with some paint peeling and minor edge cracking.
- Small cracks/line along bottom edge of stucco near sill.
- Exterior conduit/wiring running along the wall beside the window; appears unsecured.

Potential Issues:
- Peeling paint and possible wood exposure at sill (rot risk if moisture enters).
- Perimeter caulk/sealant appears aged or potentially missing in places (water intrusion risk).
- Small stucco cracks near sill (moisture ingress over time).
- Unsecured exterior wiring conduit (safety/weatherproofing concern).

Recommendations:
- Re-seal window perimeter with exterior-grade caulk; repaint/repair sill and trim; replace any decayed wood.
- Inspect and reseal/flash around the window; ensure proper drainage and sealant at joints.
- Repair stucco cracks and repaint; monitor for additional cracking.
- Secure or re-route exterior wiring/conduit with proper protection.
