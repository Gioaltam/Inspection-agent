Location:
- Bathroom ceiling, exhaust fan/light combo

Observations:
- Plastic grille/trim on textured drywall ceiling
- Center light socket/bulb exposed; lens/diffuser missing
- Light dust buildup on grille
- Metal housing visible with speckling (possible light rust)
- Trim slightly misaligned; small gap at lower edge

Potential Issues:
- Missing/detached lens exposes bulb and energized parts (shock/burn hazard)
- Gaps/voids at trim and open center allow moisture/dust entry; potential pest entry
- Possible corrosion/rust on metal housing indicating high humidity
- Misalignment/loose cover; likely missing/loose fasteners

Recommendations:
- Install correct replacement lens/diffuser; use proper damp-rated bulb/wattage
- Clean grille and housing
- Re-secure/realign trim; replace fasteners; seal minor ceiling gaps with paintable caulk
- Inspect for corrosion; replace unit if deterioration is significant
- Verify fan operates and is ducted to exterior with a working backdraft damper
