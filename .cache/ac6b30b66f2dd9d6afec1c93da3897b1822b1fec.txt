Location:
- Basement utility/furnace area.

Observations:
- Upright metal furnace/air handler with multiple warning labels.
- Large insulated black condensate/drain hose connected to unit.
- White PVC drain piping along the base with several joints; some discoloration near joints.
- Cabinet bottom shows rust/grime staining.
- Unit resting on wooden blocks/shims (small lumber piece under the base).
- Wires/cables loosely present at the lower left; no clear conduit.
- Concrete floor shows moisture staining and possible damp area near the base.

Potential Issues:
- Rust/corrosion at the furnace base (structural/operational concern).
- Condensate drain line appears to sag or be inadequately supported; potential leaks or overflow risk.
- PVC drain joints/discoloration suggesting past or active leaks.
- Improper/unstable support (wood blocks) under the unit.
- Exposed/loosely secured wiring near damp floor (electrical shock/fire risk).
- Floor moisture staining indicating possible active water intrusion or past spill/leak; potential mold risk.

Recommendations:
- Have HVAC tech assess cabinet condition; repair or replace corroded sections as needed.
- Inspect/repair condensate drain system; ensure proper slope, install a trap and an overflow/condensate catch pan with switch.
- Replace wood blocking with a proper noncombustible, level support pad and secure the unit.
- Route and secure electrical wiring within conduit; ensure proper grounding and clearances.
- Investigate and remediate moisture source; seal leaks, dry area, and consider mold remediation if warranted.
