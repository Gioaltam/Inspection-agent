Location:
- Exterior entry door (door jamb/frame shown).

Observations:
- Door frame jamb shows extensive wood rot and peeling paint along the edge.
- Wood appears softened/disintegrating with exposed substrate.
- Gaps/voids visible between door edge and frame; misalignment risk.
- Door hardware present (knob and deadbolt) with mis-matched or missing/loose strike area holes at the latch area.
- Surface staining and older paint finish; no visible sealant around edge.

Potential Issues:
- Structural rot in the door jamb; potential frame failure.
- Water intrusion risk from the damaged jamb (moisture exposure).
- Possible pest/dry rot activity in decayed wood.
- Misalignment of latch/bolt due to frame degradation; potential security/safety hazard.
- Missing/insufficient weatherstripping and sealant; air infiltration.

Recommendations:
- Have a qualified carpenter/remodeler replace the rotten door jamb section (and any damaged casing) or entire door frame as needed.
- Inspect for moisture source (exterior leak, poor flashing) and repair; treat wood to prevent recurrence.
- Replace or re-secure strike plates and ensure proper latch alignment; reinstall weatherstripping/sealant.
- Consider repainting and resealing after reconstruction; ensure proper flashing to prevent future moisture intrusion.
- Inspect for termite or other wood-destroying pests; treat if found.
