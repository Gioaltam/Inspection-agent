Location:
- Outdoor air conditioner condenser unit. Wiring exposed at top area between grill bars.

Observations:
- Damaged insulation on electrical wire; outer jacket torn with exposed conductors.
- Pinkish plastic connector/splice visible; white fibrous insulation exposed.
- Wire not enclosed in conduit or proper strain relief.
- Some rust/corrosion on nearby components and grill screw.

Potential Issues:
- Exposed live conductors risk of shock/shorts.
- Deteriorated insulation increases fire and moisture ingress risk.
- Possible rodent/chew damage suggested by exposed fibers.
- Lack of weatherproof conduit or proper protection for electrical connections.

Recommendations:
- Disconnect power and have a licensed HVAC tech repair/re-wire the connection.
- Replace damaged wiring with appropriate weatherproof cable and install proper conduit and strain relief.
- Inspect for further damage to control wiring and components; treat for pests if needed.
- Check for any refrigerant line or electrical component corrosion and address.
- After repair, ensure unit is properly sealed and test electrical continuity and operation.
