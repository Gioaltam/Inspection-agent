Location:
- Interior wall near ceiling, HVAC vent/register

Observations:
- Painted metal louvered grille with two side screws
- Textured drywall/painted surface around perimeter
- Small shadowed perimeter gap visible at edges
- One or two louvers appear slightly bent/uneven

Potential Issues:
- Minor bent/warped louvers
- Small gaps between grille flange and wall (possible air/dust leakage)
- Minor paint/joint irregularity at nearby seam (cosmetic)

Recommendations:
- Gently straighten or replace grille if airflow is restricted or noisy
- Clean louvers and visible duct dust as needed
- Apply paintable caulk/foam gasket at perimeter to reduce leakage and improve finish
- Touch up paint at nearby seam if desired
