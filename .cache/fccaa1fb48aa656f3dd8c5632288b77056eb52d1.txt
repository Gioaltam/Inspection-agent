Location:
- HVAC air handler/furnace cabinet â€“ interior access panel with labels/wiring diagram

Observations:
- Metal cabinet door/panel with manufacturer/data labels and wiring schematic
- General dust/grime on surface
- Surface rust and paint loss visible along the lower panel seam/lip

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust at bottom seam indicating moisture exposure
- Moisture staining at lower edge suggesting condensate leak or excessive condensation
- Paint/finish failure with small areas of bare metal (substrate exposure)

Recommendations:
- Have an HVAC technician inspect for moisture source; check/clear condensate drain, pan, trap, and coil for leaks or blockage
- Clean and treat rusted areas; prime and repaint to protect metal; replace panel if metal is weakened
- Clean cabinet exterior and monitor for recurring moisture during operation
