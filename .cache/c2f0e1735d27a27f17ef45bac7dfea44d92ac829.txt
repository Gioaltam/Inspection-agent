- Material: Painted wood deck boards (likely pressure-treated lumber); wooden railing posts/rails.
- Location: Exterior deck surface at edge near railing post, adjacent to grassy area.
- Observations: Paint peeling and surface deterioration; edge boards split with gaps; small plant sprouting in crack.
- Condition: Suspected wood rot/soft spots at edge; moisture exposure likely; no visible fastener failure.
- Safety/Impact: Potential trip hazard from uneven/split boards; possible structural concern if rot extends to framing.
- Recommendations: Replace damaged edge boards; inspect joists/ledger for rot; reseal/repaint; remove vegetation and ensure proper drainage and flashing.
