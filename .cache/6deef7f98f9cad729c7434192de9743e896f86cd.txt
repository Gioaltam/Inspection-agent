Location:
- Utility closet/mechanical nook with electric water heater below HVAC return plenum/filter

Observations:
- Electric water heater with CPVC piping and horizontal thermal expansion tank
- Flexible metal electrical whip entering top of heater
- HVAC return plenum with 14x18x1 pleated filter
- Condensate safety (float) switch present on drain line
- Wood shelf between heater and return plenum
- Mineral deposits visible at some hot/cold water connections
- Crowded/limited working space

Potential Issues:
- HVAC filter very dirty/clogged
- Filter misaligned/warped with visible gaps around rack (air bypass)
- Rust/corrosion on sheet-metal return plenum
- Water staining/warping on wood shelf (moisture history)
- Electrical whip enters heater without proper connector/strain relief; junction cover appears loose/damaged (improper wiring)
- Mineral deposits/corrosion at fittings indicate past/possible active seepage
- Expansion tank unsupported/cantilevered from piping (stress on joints)
- Restricted access to filter/heater components
- Gaps/voids at return plenum seams near filter (air leakage)

Recommendations:
- Replace filter now; confirm correct size and secure/seal filter rack/cover to eliminate bypass
- Inspect/repair return plenum: clean, treat corrosion, and seal seams with approved mastic/foil tape
- Trace and correct moisture source causing shelf staining (check condensate pan/drain); repair/replace or seal damaged shelf
- Have a licensed electrician correct water-heater electrical connection with proper connector/strain relief and secure cover; verify grounding/bonding
- Have a plumber evaluate/repair seepage at water connections; replace corroded parts as needed
- Provide independent support/strapping for the expansion tank
- Improve service clearance where possible for safe maintenance
- Verify TPR discharge piping and drain pan/drain compliance for the water heater; add/repair if missing or improper
- Test/clear condensate drain and float switch; general cleaning of the area
