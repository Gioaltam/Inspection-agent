Location:
- Ceiling area inside near a doorway (likely a bedroom/hall space).

Observations:
- Textured ceiling finish (popcorn/or orange-peel style).
- Two brown stains: a larger stain toward the upper-middle area and a smaller stain below it.
- Stains are discolored but no visible sagging or cracking; walls and door trim appear intact.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected moisture intrusion/water damage indicated by brown stains (source not identified).
- Possible hidden mold/mildew behind stained areas if moisture persists.
- Underlying drywall/ceiling damage may be present; potential need for remediation if material is compromised.

Recommendations:
- Investigate moisture source (roof leak, plumbing, or condensation from HVAC) and inspect above-ceiling area/attic.
- If moisture is confirmed, dry thoroughly and repair damaged ceiling material; treat mold as needed.
- Apply stain-blocking primer and repaint after complete drying.
- Improve ventilation and address humidity to prevent recurrence; monitor for new staining.
