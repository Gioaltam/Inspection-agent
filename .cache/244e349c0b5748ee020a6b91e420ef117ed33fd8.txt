Location:
- Basement/utility closet; electric water heater (two access panels on front).

Observations:
- Electric WH with two front access panels; copper cold/hot water lines on top with shut-offs.
- T&P relief valve present but discharge path not clearly visible.
- Unit sits directly on tile floor; no visible drip pan or secondary containment.
- Cramped alcove with some debris/wood pieces; exposed wiring/conduit nearby.
- Minor floor staining at base area; possible past leak.

Potential Issues:
- No drip pan or secondary containment under water heater.
- T&P relief valve discharge piping not clearly visible or may be improperly routed.
- Limited clearance/ventilation in the tight closet (servicing and heat dissipation concerns).
- Cramped wiring/conduit near the unit; potential protection/strapping concerns.
- Floor staining suggests possible past leakage; check for active leaks.

Recommendations:
- Verify and, if needed, install proper T&P relief discharge pipe directed to a safe location (floor drain or exterior).
- Install a drain pan with an appropriate drain if local code requires, and ensure area is dry.
- Ensure minimum clearances per manufacturer (and local code) and improve ventilation for the closet if required.
- Inspect and secure piping; replace or re-seat any aged/shaky valves; add supports/straps as needed.
- Have an electrician verify the feed/disconnect is accessible and properly installed.
- Investigate and address any active leaks; monitor for further staining and consider WH replacement if age or leaks persist.
