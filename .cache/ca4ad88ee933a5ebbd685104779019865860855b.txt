- Location: Outdoor central air condenser unit; Material: metal cabinet with louvered panels. Label: R-410A refrigerant.
- Condition: Edge of left-front cabinet shows chipped paint and minor corrosion; potential for further rust if not treated.
- Debris: Dry leaves accumulating at the base; moisture retention risk and can obstruct airflow.
- Clearance: Vegetation/debris in contact with unit; trim back to maintain at least 2â€“3 ft side clearance (and 5 ft above) for service access and airflow.
- Overall: No obvious refrigerant leaks visible on the accessible panels; unit appears structurally intact aside from edge corrosion and debris buildup.
