Location:
- Exterior entry door area at base of doorway adjacent to blue siding.

Observations:
- Vertical wooden jamb/trim shows peeling paint and exposed wood.
- Significant weathering/rotting at the bottom of the jamb and near the sill.
- Dark staining and green moss/algae growth on the bottom of the door and concrete threshold.
- Gaps and missing/failed sealant along the door jamb and at the bottom edge.
- Overall moisture staining indicates prior moisture exposure.

Potential Issues:
- Wood rot in door jamb and trim (structural concern if untreated).
- Moisture intrusion risk at bottom edge due to missing sealant and algae growth.
- Mold/mildew growth on door edge and threshold.
- Possible termite/wood-damage risk in decayed wood.
- Inadequate flashing/drainage at threshold allowing water intrusion.

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair rotted jamb and trim; treat wood with preservative; ensure proper flashing.
- Re-caulk and reseal perimeter gaps around door; install new weatherstripping.
- Clean mold/mildew from door and threshold; apply exterior-grade protective coating.
- Inspect interior framing for moisture damage and repair as needed.
- Check and improve drainage around door (gutter downspouts, flashing, slope away from door).
- Consider replacing door unit if frame damage is extensive.
