Location:
- Base kitchen cabinets under counter.

Observations:
- Light blue painted, wood/particleboard cabinet doors; surfaces chipped and rough.
- Doors are misaligned; noticeable gap between left and right doors; left door not flush.
- Handles show rust/corrosion; likely loose fasteners (screws appear protruding).
- Bottom cabinet edge and toe area show wear; possible water staining and paint blistering.
- Countertop edge/top area dirty; visible grime buildup near front edge.

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids between cabinet doors (misalignment) allowing moisture ingress.
- Possible water intrusion/leaks evidenced by bottom edge staining and worn paint.
- Substrate exposure/rot risk at lower panels from wear and moisture.
- Corrosion and potential looseness of door hardware (loose/rusted fasteners).
- Lack of sealant/caulk at seams and edges (potential moisture pathway).

Recommendations:
- Inspect under-sink plumbing for leaks; repair any leaks and dry out cabinet; replace damaged bottom panels if rot is present.
- Realign/reinstall doors or replace affected doors; tighten/replace hinges and hardware; consider new handles.
- Clean, repair, and repaint; seal exposed edges and gaps with appropriate caulk and paint to reduce moisture intrusion.
- Consider replacing severely worn cabinet sections with water-resistant material if structural integrity is compromised.
