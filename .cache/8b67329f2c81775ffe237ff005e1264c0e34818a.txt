Location: Bedroom wall behind bed

What I See: 
- Multiple paint/finish chips and scrapes on the wall paneling, exposing the brown substrate.
- Marks align with the bed frame height, likely from contact/rubbing.

Issues to Address:
- Wall finish damaged (chipped/peeled paint and minor surface gouges). No structural damage visible.

Recommended Action:
- Lightly sand loose edges, fill gouges with wood filler/spackle, sand smooth.
- Prime repaired areas with a bonding/stain-blocking primer and repaint to match.
- Add bumpers or a wall guard behind the bed or pull the frame slightly off the wall to prevent repeat damage.
