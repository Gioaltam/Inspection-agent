Location: Bedroom wall behind bed

What I See:
- White paneled wall with several scraped/peeled spots exposing brown substrate at bed height.
- Light scuffing around the damaged areas.

Issues to Address:
- Finish/paint loss with exposed substrate on wall panel.

Recommended Action:
- Clean area, scrape any loose material, fill gouges with lightweight spackle/wood filler, sand smooth.
- Prime with a bonding/stain-blocking primer and repaint to match.
- Add a bed bumper/headboard guard or pull the bed slightly off the wall to prevent repeat abrasion.
