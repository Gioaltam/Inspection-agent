Location:
- Cabinet/toe-kick at floor edge near a sink (bath or kitchen), adjacent to a floor mat

Observations:
- White toe-kick/base trim below a light wood cabinet/shelf
- Noticeable vertical drip stains/discoloration on toe-kick face
- Small gap/separation at inside corner; caulk bead appears thin/irregular
- Floor mat/rug against the base

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/stains on toe-kick indicating prior or ongoing moisture
- Gaps/separation and failed/missing caulk at joints can allow moisture and pest entry
- No visible dents, bends, warping, cracks, loose/missing parts, substrate exposure, corrosion/rust, mold/mildew, wiring issues, or trip hazards

Recommendations:
- Inspect above for active leaks (sink, countertop, plumbing); dry area and monitor
- Clean and sanitize stained surfaces; repaint/refinish as needed
- Remove deteriorated caulk; recaulk/seal all seams at corner and base to floor
- If moisture damage/swelling is found behind toe-kick, repair or replace affected materials
- Keep floor mat dry; launder regularly to prevent moisture retention
