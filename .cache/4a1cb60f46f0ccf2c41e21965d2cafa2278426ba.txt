Location:
- Melrose property inspection checklist page (notes refer to front door, flooring, garage window, and toilets).

Observations:
- Handwritten notes indicate: front door rotten; floors rotten (not in kitchen); garage window missing.
- Toilet (vaso sanit√°rio) needs to be installed.
- Lawn notes: front yard ok; back yard a little tall.

Potential Issues:
- Front door rotten: security and weather/seal concerns; potential drafts.
- Rotten flooring: possible water damage and structural substrate exposure.
- Garage window missing: weather intrusion, security risk, pest entry potential.
- Toilet not installed: sanitation/code violation until resolved.
- Back yard tall grass: maintenance/pest entry risk.

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair rotten front door; inspect and fix frame, weatherstripping, and sealant.
- Assess and remediate rotten flooring; locate moisture source and install new flooring/substrate as needed.
- Install a proper garage window with flashing and sealing; ensure weatherproofing.
- Install and plumb the toilet; verify venting and leaks.
- Complete lawn maintenance (front ok, back trimmed) and ensure drainage to minimize pest and moisture issues.
