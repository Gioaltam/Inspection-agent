Location:
- Exterior window at base of stucco wall; bottom sash/track area visible with screen in place.

Observations:
- Aluminum window sill/trim shows a dent/crease near the center.
- Small gap apparent between the sill and the window frame.
- Two round protrusions on the stucco below the window (likely fastener heads/anchors).
- Light cracking/separation in the stucco at the sill line; some surface staining/red specks on the sill edge.
- Screen appears intact.

Potential Issues:
- Dent in window sill trim could affect sealant/flashing integrity.
- Gap at the frame-sill joint may allow water intrusion if not sealed.
- Stucco crack/separation at the sill line could permit moisture intrusion.
- No clear active leaks shown, but risk exists with these gaps/cracks.

Recommendations:
- Repair dented sill trim; reseal/flash bottom edge and re-caulk perimeter.
- Seal/frame gap; ensure proper flashing under the sill to direct water away.
- Repair stucco crack/separation near sill; refinish and repaint as needed.
- Inspect for moisture behind wall if any staining appears during rain; monitor and address promptly.
