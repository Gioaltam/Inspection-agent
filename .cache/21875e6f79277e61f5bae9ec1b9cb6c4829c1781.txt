Location:
- Exterior brick wall window area; bottom sash region.

Observations:
- Wood window trim and sill with heavy peeling paint.
- Lower sill appears cracked/soft and shows signs of rot/damage.
- Exterior caulking/sealant around window looks degraded.
- Brick below window shows some surface cracking; no obvious structural separation shown.
- Electrical conduit and weatherproof junction box mounted along wall; appears intact.

Potential Issues:
- Deteriorated/rotted window sill and trim risk water intrusion.
- Gaps/incorrect sealant around window frame allowing moisture intrusion.
- Possible long-term wood rot/pest damage if moisture persists.
- Exterior seal integrity around conduit entry not fully visible; ensure weatherproofing.

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace rotted wood at sill/trim; install proper flashing and exterior caulk/sealant around window.
- Repaint repaired trim to protect wood.
- Inspect interior for water stains or drywall damage; repair as needed.
- Consider window replacement if frame integrity is poor.
- Verify electrical conduit entry is weatherproofed and secured; seal as necessary.
