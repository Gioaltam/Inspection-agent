Location:
- HVAC return air filter housing (rectangular duct opening) in utility/ceiling area.

Observations:
- 14x18x1 pleated filter installed (HDX label visible).
- Filter appears very dirty/dust-coated.
- Filter frame sits at a diagonal/insecure angle within the housing.
- Interior surfaces show dust buildup and surface staining; bottom tray/edge appears dirty.
- Surrounding metal housing shows dust/possible corrosion signs; no visible sealant around opening.

Potential Issues:
- Clogged/dusty filter reducing airflow and system efficiency.
- Filter not seated flush, creating air bypass around filter.
- Dust buildup inside housing; potential for mold growth if moisture is present.
- Possible moisture exposure indicated by staining and corrosion on housing.
- Lack of visible sealing/gasket around opening (air leakage path).

Recommendations:
- Replace filter with correct size and ensure it seats flat against the frame.
- Clean housing interior and remove accumulated dust.
- Inspect for moisture or leaks; address any condensation or water intrusion; treat/replace corroded components if needed.
- Add or improve sealing around the opening to prevent air bypass.
- If humidity or mold risk is suspected, have HVAC tech evaluate and, if necessary, perform mold remediation.
