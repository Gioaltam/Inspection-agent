Location:
- Interior wall/ceiling HVAC register (textured painted drywall)

Observations:
- Painted metal louvered register with vertical center vanes and horizontal top/bottom louvers
- Single visible mounting screw at top; register appears surface-mounted
- Moderate dust/soil on louvers and frame
- Hairline vertical crack in drywall above and below register

Potential Issues:
- Bent/warped and misaligned louvers; partial airflow obstruction
- Hairline drywall crack (movement/shrinkage)
- Dust/debris accumulation on grill; reduced airflow/air quality potential

Recommendations:
- Clean louvers and frame; replace/clean HVAC filter; consider duct cleaning if buildup persists
- Replace register if louvers cannot be straightened for proper operation
- Repair and monitor drywall crack; patch/paint after stabilization
- Verify register is securely fastened and seated flush to surface
