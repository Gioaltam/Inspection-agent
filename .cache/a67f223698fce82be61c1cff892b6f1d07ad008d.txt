- Exterior aluminum sliding window with metal screen; ground-floor exposure near a red concrete deck.
- Window sill is a concrete/stone surface with visible dirt and dust buildup.
- Bottom track shows debris and slight metal tarnish/corrosion; screen remains intact (no tears).
- No visible cracks in the glass; no obvious damage to the screen framing.
- Exterior sealant/caulk not clearly visible; suggest resealing at the perimeter and ensuring slope/drainage away from the window.
