Location:
- 3351 Hillsdale Ave, Unit A

Observations:
- Handwritten inspection checklist page visible.
- Legible items: “persianas OK” (blinds OK); “puerta quebrada” (door broken); “grama OK” and “grama mucho” (grass OK / grass much/overgrown); references to AC and water drainage (last lines) are partially legible but context is unclear.
- No other structural or material conditions visible in the photo.

Potential Issues:
- Door broken (security/safety concern).
- Grass overgrowth (pest habitat risk; possible moisture/maintenance deficiency).
- Ambiguous notes regarding AC and drainage; potential water drainage issue if condensate line or related plumbing is not functioning properly.

Recommendations:
- Repair or replace broken door; verify latch/lock and hinge condition.
- Mow/trim lawn and control vegetation; ensure clear perimeter to reduce pest ingress and moisture retention.
- Verify AC condensate drainage operation; inspect for leaks or standing water risk; clear any blocked drain lines.
- Obtain clarification on unclear items from the on-site inspection and document specifics.
