Location:
- Shower/tub surround area; metal grab bar mounted to tiled wall.

Observations:
- Round flange mounting plate shows surface rust around edge.
- Visible screw in flange also shows corrosion.
- Tile and grout appear intact; no obvious water stains on visible surfaces.
- No sealant visible around flange area.

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion of grab bar flange and fasteners; potential for loose mounting.
- Possible water intrusion behind tile due to rust and lack of visible sealant at flange.
- Risk of mold/rot behind wall if moisture intrusion is ongoing.

Recommendations:
- Replace grab bar hardware with corrosion-resistant (stainless) mounting and reseal flange area.
- Re-seal around flange with silicone/appropriate caulk; ensure proper waterproofing.
- Inspect behind tile for moisture damage; repair or regrout/retile if needed.
- Monitor for any new rust or movement after reinstallation.
