Location:
- Interior floor â€“ wood-look laminate/vinyl planks (room unspecified)

Observations:
- Floating plank floor with oak pattern
- Multiple planks show surface gouges and missing wear layer
- Brown core/substrate visible at several spots
- Open seams and misaligned butt joints
- Some plank edges lifted/peaked; uneven plane

Potential Issues:
- Chips/gouges and substrate exposure
- Gaps/separations and misalignment at joints
- Edge lifting/warping; possible swelling
- Trip hazard from raised/lipped boards
- Potential water intrusion into exposed core through gaps

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged planks and any swollen pieces
- Reseat/repair locking joints to eliminate gaps and lipping
- Inspect subfloor for flatness and moisture; correct as needed
- Check perimeter/transition details for proper expansion space
- Clean debris from seams; monitor for recurring movement or moisture signs
