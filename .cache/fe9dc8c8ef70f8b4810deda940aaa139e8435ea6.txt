Location:
- HVAC air handler/indoor unit base area (filter/condensate side)

Observations:
- Disposable 18x20x1 filter partially inserted; appears bowed
- PVC condensate line with condensate pump present
- Metal cabinet and frame; rusted screws and surfaces
- Mineral deposits and staining on floor and pump; debris/dust buildup
- Low‑voltage wires with wire nuts draped on floor; cords present

Potential Issues:
- Water intrusion/leaks: widespread floor staining/mineral residue; deposits on pump/lines
- Corrosion/rust: heavy on cabinet frame and fasteners; paint loss/substrate exposure
- Gaps/voids/misalignment: filter not fully seated; visible bypass around filter rack
- Warped/bent filter media
- Loose/unsecured wiring: splices and cords on floor near moisture; potential damage/short; service trip hazard
- Possible mold/mildew on damp surfaces due to chronic moisture

Recommendations:
- Have licensed HVAC technician diagnose and correct source of condensate leakage; clean/flush drain, test pump/float, verify trap/slope
- Replace air filter; ensure correct size/orientation and tight seal; add/repair filter rack cover/gasket to eliminate bypass
- Clean and dry area; disinfect surfaces; monitor for ongoing moisture
- Address corrosion: clean/treat rust; repair/replace deteriorated cabinet parts and fasteners
- Secure and protect wiring: elevate off floor, properly support; place any line‑voltage connections in an approved junction box; keep cords clear of water
- Consider secondary drain pan and insulation on cold lines to reduce future condensation
