Location:
- HVAC air handler/coil cabinet base, interior utility area

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with PVC condensate line and condensate pump below
- 18x20x1 pleated filter in horizontal slot; slot open with no cover
- PVC drain pipe routed across filter face
- Heavy surface rust on cabinet/frame and screws
- Rust/mineral staining and residue on floor around pump
- Low‑voltage wires spliced with wire nuts; dangling near floor/pump
- General dirt/debris in compartment

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion/rust on cabinet and fasteners; possible metal deterioration
- Evidence of water intrusion/leaks at condensate system (staining/residue)
- Filter misaligned/dented; open filter slot creates gaps/unfiltered air bypass
- Drain pipe obstructs filter, causing bending/damage; service access impeded
- Loose/dangling wiring near wet area; risk of damage/short
- Possible microbial growth on nearby surfaces due to moisture

Recommendations:
- Have HVAC tech diagnose/repair condensate system; clean lines, verify trap/slope, test/replace pump as needed
- Replace filter and install proper, sealed filter rack/cover; reroute/support drain to allow clear filter access
- Treat/remove rust; evaluate cabinet/pan integrity and repair/replace corroded components
- Clean and dry area; sanitize and consider mold assessment/remediation if growth confirmed
- Secure and protect low‑voltage wiring; elevate off floor and fasten neatly
- Schedule full HVAC service for performance and safety check
