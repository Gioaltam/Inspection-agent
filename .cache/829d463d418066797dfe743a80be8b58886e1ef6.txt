Location: Interior doorway/hall

What I See:
- Noticeable gap along the right door casing where it meets the wall/jamb.
- Hairline cracks visible in the adjacent wall finish.

Issues to Address:
- Loose/separating door casing.
- Cosmetic wall cracks.

Recommended Action:
- Reâ€‘secure the door casing with finish nails/screws; shim as needed to close the gap, then caulk and repaint.
- Fill hairline wall cracks with joint compound, sand smooth, prime, and paint; monitor for any widening that could indicate movement.
