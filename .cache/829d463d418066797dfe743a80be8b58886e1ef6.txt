Location: Hallway doorway wall

What I See:
- Long hairline crack across the wall surface.
- Visible gap where the door casing/jamb has pulled away from the wall on the right side.

Issues to Address:
- Separation of door casing/jamb from wall.
- Cracked drywall/plaster.

Recommended Action:
- Have a carpenter re-secure and shim the door casing/jamb, then caulk and paint.
- Repair wall crack with joint tape and compound; sand and repaint.
- Monitor for movement (widening cracks, doors sticking). If movement continues or gaps exceed about 1/8â€“1/4 in, have a licensed contractor/structural professional evaluate for framing/settlement issues.
