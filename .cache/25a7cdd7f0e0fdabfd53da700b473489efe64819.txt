Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (bath/kitchen)

Observations:
- Two angle-stop shutoff valves with braided supply lines
- PVC drain/trap arm to wall via rubber sleeve coupling; metal cover plates at wall
- Flexible metallic conduit (electrical) entering cabinet at left
- Cabinet bottom/back painted wood/particle board with stains and edge wear
- Small holes/gaps at back and floor penetrations

Potential Issues:
- Water staining on back and base; evidence of past leak
- Surface deterioration/peeling and substrate exposure at cabinet bottom
- Black spotting on surfaces; possible mold/mildew
- Unshielded rubber drain coupling with single clamp; not a proper trap adapter and prone to leaks/misalignment
- Electrical flex conduit appears unsecured and not terminated in a visible junction box; potential improper wiring/missing strain relief
- Gaps/voids around pipe penetrations; potential pest entry points

Recommendations:
- Have plumber evaluate/replace rubber drain coupling with proper trap adapter or shielded noâ€‘hub coupling; check entire trap for leaks
- Dry, clean, and disinfect cabinet; repair/replace damaged cabinet base if softened or swollen
- Licensed electrician to secure conduit and terminate in approved box with connector/bushing
- Seal/caulk penetrations and add proper escutcheons/grommets to deter pests/moisture
- Monitor shutoff valves and supply lines; replace if leaking or corroded
