Location: Unclear (likely kitchen sink/counter area)

What I See:
- Image is heavily motion-blurred
- Main subject cannot be identified

Issues to Address:
- No repairs can be confirmed from this photo

Recommended Action:
- Retake a clear, well-lit, in-focus photo of the intended item (sink, countertop edge, or appliance door). Hold the camera steady, fill the frame with the subject, and capture any specific damage (cracks, leaks, stains) if present.
