Location: Sink area

What I See: The photo is heavily motion‑blurred; appears to show a sink basin and counter. No specific defect is clearly visible.

Issues to Address: None confirmed from this image.

Recommended Action: Retake a clear, well‑lit, steady photo centered on the sink, faucet, rim/caulk, and the plumbing below. While there, run water and check for leaks, cracks, loose fixtures, or deteriorated sealant and document if found.
