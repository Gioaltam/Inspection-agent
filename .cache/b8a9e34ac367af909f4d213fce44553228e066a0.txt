Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit (Goodman) mounted at ground level near gravel landscaping.

Observations:
- Exterior cabinet shows rust on two top screws.
- Fins appear slightly bent/damaged in a few areas.
- Vegetation and loose rocks/ground cover are in contact with or very close to the base.
- No visible stains or leaks on the cabinet surface in this view.

Potential Issues:
- Corrosion on mounting screws (rust) may loosen hardware over time.
- Bent fins can reduce airflow and efficiency.
- Inadequate clearance due to nearby vegetation/rocks; potential airflow restriction and pest ingress.
- Debris/build-up at the base could enter the unit or impede drainage.

Recommendations:
- Improve clearance: remove vegetation/rocks directly against the cabinet; maintain at least 2â€“3 ft of clear space around unit (and above if possible).
- Replace or treat rusty screws; check mounting hardware for corrosion and security.
- Straighten bent fins with a fin comb or have a pro assess coil condition; address excessive damage if present.
- Clean around the unit and remove debris; ensure drainage away from the condenser.
- Have HVAC tech inspect refrigerant lines, electrical connections, and overall operation during the next service.
