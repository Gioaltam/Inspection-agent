Location:
- Interior side of a painted entry door with surface-mounted door closer

Observations:
- Smooth, painted flush door; likely metal or solid-core
- Surface-mounted hydraulic closer at top
- Small round through-hole at mid/eye level (appears missing door viewer)
- Minor scuffs on door surface; trim/paint generally intact

Potential Issues:
- Gap/void: open penetration through door (missing viewer/plug)
- Security/privacy concern from open hole
- Potential air/pest infiltration via hole
- If door is fire-rated, penetration compromises fire/smoke barrier
- No visible dents, bends, warping, cracks, corrosion, or misalignment

Recommendations:
- Install a code-compliant door viewer or solid metal plug to close hole
- If door is fire-rated, patch with listed fire-rated kit per manufacturer or replace door to maintain rating
- Seal and touch up paint after repair
- Verify closer operation/latching after work is completed
