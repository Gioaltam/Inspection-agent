Location: General (per inspection checklist)

What I See:
- Handwritten inspection notes listing multiple defects.
- Items called out: loose stair handrail, broken upstairs bathroom sink, exterior leak, broken bathroom window.

Issues to Address:
- Stair handrail loosening.
- Upstairs bathroom sink broken.
- Exterior leak reported.
- Bathroom window broken.

Recommended Action:
- Handrail: Re-secure to wall studs with proper anchors or replace brackets; verify it meets code for height/strength.
- Upstairs sink: Replace cracked/broken basin and check drain/fixture connections for leaks.
- Exterior leak: Trace source (roof, siding/trim, flashing, or exterior plumbing), repair/replace failed materials, then dry and inspect interior for water damage or mold.
- Bathroom window: Replace broken glass/sash; ensure operability and weather sealing. If shards present, make area safe until replacement.
