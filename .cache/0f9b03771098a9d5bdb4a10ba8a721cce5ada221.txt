Location: Property-wide (handwritten inspection checklist)

What I See:
- Photo shows notes listing multiple repair items.
- Also mentions tall grass, ants, and AC filter size 18x20; blinds noted as OK.

Issues to Address:
- Stair handrail is coming loose.
- Upstairs bathroom sink is broken.
- Exterior leak reported (location unspecified).
- Bathroom window is broken.

Recommended Action:
- Re-secure or replace the stair handrail; tighten anchors into studs and verify stability.
- Repair/replace the upstairs bathroom sink and inspect plumbing connections; seal with new caulk as needed.
- Trace the exterior leak (check hose bibs, siding/roof penetrations) and repair the source; dry and remediate any moisture damage.
- Replace or repair the broken bathroom window; ensure proper glazing and weather seal.
