Location:
- Ceiling/attic vent grille (louvered) area; interior side visible.

Observations:
- White metal grille with horizontal slats in a grid pattern.
- Interior surfaces appear dark/dusty brown; grime on slats.
- Edges and frame appear intact; no obvious physical damage.

Potential Issues:
- Dust/dirt buildup on ventilation opening (air quality concern).
- Dark staining suggests possible moisture exposure; investigate for leaks or condensation.
- No visible insect screen or sealant observed; potential pest entry point if exterior.

Recommendations:
- Clean/grime removal of grille interior; vacuum or wipe surfaces.
- Inspect for moisture source; check roof/ceiling for leaks; if mold is suspected, test and remediate.
- Verify seal around opening; add appropriate weatherproofing or caulk if gaps are present.
- If exterior vent, ensure intact insect screen and proper termination to minimize pest entry.
