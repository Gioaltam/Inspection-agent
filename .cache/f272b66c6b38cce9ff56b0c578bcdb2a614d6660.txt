Location:
- Exterior left side yard of main house; along wall with utilities and AC condenser

Observations:
- Horizontal lap siding; painted white
- Wood eaves/soffit/fascia above
- Exterior electrical panel/enclosure mounted on wall
- Low-voltage/communication cable draped down wall
- Several wall penetrations for wiring/conduit
- Trash bins, tarp, and stored items against wall; narrow concrete strip at base
- No gutters visible along this eave

Potential Issues:
- Peeling/failed paint at eaves/soffit with wood substrate exposed
- Open electrical panel door exposing components; potential shock hazard
- Unsecured/drooping exterior cable; not properly supported
- Gaps/unsealed penetrations at siding around cables/conduitâ€”possible water/pest entry
- Stored items and bins obstruct access and create trip/working-clearance hazards near electrical equipment
- Surface staining on siding; possible moisture splashback from lack of gutters

Recommendations:
- Prep, prime, and repaint eaves/soffit; repair/replace any rotted wood
- Close and secure panel cover; have a licensed electrician evaluate enclosure, verify deadfront/knockouts, and correct any exposed wiring; secure exterior cabling with proper fasteners/conduit as required
- Seal all wall penetrations with exterior-rated caulk/boots
- Relocate trash bins and stored items to maintain clear, safe access (minimum 3 ft working clearance at electrical)
- Clean siding; monitor for recurring moisture; consider installing gutters/downspouts to control runoff
