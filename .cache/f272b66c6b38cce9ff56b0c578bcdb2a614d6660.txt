Location:
- Exterior side yard along main house wall; near electrical service and AC condenser

Observations:
- Painted horizontal lap siding; concrete stem at base
- Eave/fascia with aged, peeling paint
- Wall-mounted electrical service cabinet; door/cover open
- Loose low‑voltage/communication cable draped down wall; wall penetration visible
- Ground‑mounted AC condenser nearby
- Trash bins, blue tarp and stored items tight to wall; narrow access path

Potential Issues:
- Electrical panel/box open; energized parts potentially exposed; weather intrusion risk
- Unsecured/sagging cable; lacks proper support/conduit; penetration unsealed (gap)
- Peeling/failed paint at eaves/fascia; exposed substrate; moisture/rot risk
- Stored items/bins block safe access to electrical equipment; trip hazard
- Items near condenser may restrict airflow/maintenance clearance
- Debris/vegetation against foundation; potential pest harborage/entry via unsealed holes

Recommendations:
- Close and secure panel cover; have a licensed electrician evaluate enclosure, install proper cover/gasket, and route/support cables in approved raceway
- Seal all wall penetrations with exterior‑grade sealant; add proper cable clamps
- Scrape, prime, and repaint eaves/fascia; repair any damaged/rotted wood
- Relocate trash bins and stored items; maintain clear working space (panel ~36 in, condenser per manufacturer)
- Remove debris/vegetation near foundation; keep area clean and monitor for pests
