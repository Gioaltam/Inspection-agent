- Location/construct: Exterior window on brick veneer; white painted wood trim with a concrete/stone sill; black vinyl window frame with screen present.

- Surface condition: Paint peeling and flaking on the trim and sill edge; some chipping along the bottom edge of the sill.

- Sill condition: Concrete sill shows minor chips/damage; debris (sticks/needles) on the ledge.

- Frame/glazing: Window frame appears intact; no visible cracks in glass from this view; screen in place.

- Moisture risk: Peeling paint may indicate moisture exposure behind trim; inspect for wood rot or water intrusion behind trim.

- Maintenance recommended: Repaint/caulk trim, repair/patch sill as needed, clean debris, and inspect behind trim for rot or gaps.
