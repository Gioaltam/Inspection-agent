- Interior of cabinet visible; wood appears dirty and potentially weakened.
- Mop/wringer bucket on the floor with standing water; mop handle leaning against cabinet.
- General signs of moisture exposure around the base of the cabinet and on the cabinet face.

Potential Issues:

- Inspect under-sink plumbing for leaks; fix any leaks and re-caulk seams as needed.
- Check for mold and perform remediation if detected; consider professional assessment if moisture persists.
