Location:
- Interior window, drywall return with curtain; view of head/jamb area

Observations:
- Vinyl window with interior grids; painted drywall return
- Metal blind/rod bracket mounted at head; no blind/rail present
- Caulk/paint at trim-to-frame seams rough/uneven, small visible gaps at head/jamb
- Window glass appears dirty; curtain partially covering opening

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/separation at interior trim-to-frame joint may allow air/insects and moisture
- Exposed/unused metal bracket presents minor cut/impact hazard if left uncovered
- Localized paint/caulk cracking/chips at return edges

Recommendations:
- Re-caulk/seal perimeter joints around window frame; smooth and finish
- Remove unused bracket or complete installation; ensure bracket is securely fastened
- Prep, patch, and repaint interior returns to protect substrate
- Clean window/glass and check screen/operation during full inspection
