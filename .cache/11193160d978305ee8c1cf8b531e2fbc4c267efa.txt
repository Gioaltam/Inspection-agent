Location:
- Front exterior: façade, entry porch, wood ramp, sidewalk/yard

Observations:
- One-story house; asphalt shingle roof; vinyl siding; small covered entry
- Wood access ramp with simple wood guardrails; weathered finish
- No gutters visible at front eave
- Organic growth/stains on right-front siding; vegetation touching siding
- Concrete sidewalk to ramp; turf encroaching
- Loose cable/cord/hose visible near right side of ramp

Potential Issues:
- Ramp boards cracked/split/warped; suspected rot at lower boards
- Loose/missing fasteners; sections of ramp misaligned
- Handrails/guards loose/damaged; openings large; low height; likely not to current safety standards
- Uneven transition and gaps between sidewalk and ramp; missing/loose boards — trip/fall hazard
- Worn/peeling finish exposing bare wood; lacks non-slip surface
- No edge protection on ramp — fall risk
- Algae/mildew staining on siding; moisture exposure; possible water intrusion risk
- No gutters/downspouts at front — splash-back onto siding/ramp
- Vegetation against siding — pest/rot risk
- Unsecured surface cord/hose — trip hazard
- Possible gaps at bottom of siding near ramp area — potential pest entry

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed contractor evaluate and repair/rebuild ramp to current safety standards (structure, proper handrails/guards/edge protection, non-slip surface, proper landings)
- Replace decayed/damaged boards; re-secure with corrosion-resistant fasteners; correct misalignment and sidewalk transition
- Install gutters/downspouts with directed drainage away from house and ramp
- Clean siding and ramp to remove algae/mildew; seal/paint wood surfaces
- Trim vegetation away from siding; maintain clearance from grade
- Inspect lower siding for gaps; repair/replace and seal; add pest screening as needed
- Remove or secure any loose cords/hoses near the entry path
