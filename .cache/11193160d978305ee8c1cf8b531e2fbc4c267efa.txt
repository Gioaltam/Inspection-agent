Location:
- Front exterior facade and entry approach/ramp

Observations:
- Single-story home with vinyl siding and asphalt shingle gable roof
- Small covered stoop; no gutters/downspouts visible at eaves
- Wood wheelchair ramp with cross-braced rails; painted, heavily weathered
- Organic staining/algae on right-front siding; vine growth on left facade
- Wood privacy fence at right side yard

Potential Issues:
- Ramp: warped/cupped/cracked decking boards; broken/missing boards near foot; loose/missing fasteners; misaligned/leaning rails; open guard/rail gaps; failed/peeling paint with bare wood substrate exposure
- Trip/fall hazards at uneven transition from concrete to ramp; damaged board at base; loose doormat on sidewalk
- Suspected wood rot at ramp components from prolonged moisture exposure
- Failed/missing sealant/paint on exterior wood elements
- Mold/mildew/algae staining on siding; potential moisture/splash-back
- Vegetation/vines against siding—holds moisture and creates pest pathways
- No gutters present—risk of water splash-back, siding staining, and foundation moisture
- Possible pest entry points where siding terminates low to grade/around ramp interface (limited view)

Recommendations:
- Restrict use of ramp; have a qualified contractor evaluate and rebuild/repair to provide sound structure, secure fasteners, proper handrails/guards, code-compliant slope/landings, and slip-resistant surface
- Replace any rotted/damaged ramp boards and rails; realign rails; tighten/replace fasteners; remove/replace loose doormat
- Scrape, prime, and repaint/seal all exterior wood after repairs
- Clean siding (soft wash) to remove algae/mildew; monitor for recurring moisture
- Install gutters and downspouts with proper discharge away from foundation
- Trim/remove vegetation contacting siding; maintain clearance from grade
- Inspect siding-to-foundation/ramp interfaces for gaps; seal to deter pests and moisture intrusion
