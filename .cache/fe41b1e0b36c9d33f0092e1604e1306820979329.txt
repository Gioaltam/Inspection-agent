Location:
- Interior wall near ceiling; small louvered HVAC register/grille

Observations:
- Painted textured drywall
- Metal louvered register with two screws; adjustable center lever
- Moderate dust/soot on louvers and along top edge
- Dark “ghosting” stain on wall just above register
- One louver appears bent/out of alignment
- Register appears generally secure; no visible rust

Potential Issues:
- Dust buildup and wall staining indicate dirty airflow and/or air leakage at register/duct boot
- Bent louver may restrict or misdirect airflow
- Possible unsealed gap at boot-to-drywall suggested by filtration staining
- No visible water intrusion, cracks, missing fasteners, or electrical hazards

Recommendations:
- Clean grille and surrounding surface; replace HVAC filter; consider duct/coil cleaning if debris persists
- Straighten or replace damaged register
- Air-seal boot-to-drywall with mastic/caulk to prevent filtration soiling; repaint after cleaning
- HVAC technician to evaluate airflow balance and confirm tight duct connection, especially if this is a return grille
