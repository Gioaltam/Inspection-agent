Location:
- Ceiling/wall-mounted HVAC register (room unspecified)

Observations:
- Small metal louvered register with two visible screws
- Noticeable dust/soot on louvers and along top edge of grille
- Slight discoloration/smudging on adjacent drywall
- One center louver appears bent/out of alignment
- Minor gap/shadowing at top flange where grille meets drywall

Potential Issues:
- Dust buildup may restrict airflow and distribute particulates
- Bent louver may reduce/alter airflow; potential damage
- Possible air leakage at register-to-drywall joint drawing dust (gap/void)
- Minor surface stain on drywall; no clear signs of active water intrusion or mold
- No visible corrosion, missing fasteners, or electrical concerns

Recommendations:
- Remove and clean register; vacuum/brush duct boot just behind grille
- Straighten or replace damaged register if it doesnâ€™t operate smoothly
- Seal the duct boot to drywall behind the grille with mastic/caulk to reduce leakage and dust streaking
- Check/replace HVAC filters; consider duct cleaning if heavy debris persists
- Clean and touch up paint on surrounding drywall; monitor for recurring staining
