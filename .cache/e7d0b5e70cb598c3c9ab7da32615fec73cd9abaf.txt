Location: Front yard lawn

What I See:
- Grass is significantly overgrown with tall seed heads.
- Broadleaf weeds/clover present and turf height is uneven.

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed

Recommended Action:
- Mow and edge the lawn; reduce height to about 3–4 inches.
- String-trim around beds and maintain 12–18 inches of clearance from the foundation to reduce pest harborage.
- Spot-treat broadleaf weeds with a post-emergent herbicide and consider a pre-emergent for future control.
- Follow up with fertilization and regular watering to improve turf density.
