Location: Front yard lawn

What I See:
- Grass is significantly overgrown with tall seed heads.
- Mixed turf with noticeable weeds and patchy coverage.

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed.

Recommended Action:
- Mow and trim to a consistent height (about 3â€“4 inches); bag clippings on the first cut.
- Treat weeds with a selective post-emergent herbicide and spot-spray as needed.
- Overseed or sod thin/bare areas after mowing; resume a regular mow/water/fertilizer schedule.
