Location:
- Ceiling vent in interior utility/space area.

Observations:
- White rectangular metal vent cover with center curved louvers and two outer bank louvers.
- Dust/dirt on grille; small cobwebs in lower corner.
- One mounting screw visible on left edge; no screw visible on right edge.
- Textured ceiling/plaster around vent; minor edge/corner staining.

Potential Issues:
- Loose or missing fastener on the right side (vent cover not fully secured).
- Dust buildup on vent blades (airflow may be reduced if not cleaned).
- Minor near-edge staining that could indicate moisture access (not confirmed).

Recommendations:
- Tighten/replace vent mounting screws to secure cover.
- Clean vent grille and blades; inspect for corrosion if present.
- Inspect surrounding area for moisture intrusion; reseal or repair if stains or dampness are found.
