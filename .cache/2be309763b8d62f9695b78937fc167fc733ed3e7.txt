Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet (under-sink area)

Observations:
- Double-bowl sink; plastic tubular drain/waste arm with slip-joint fittings
- Braided water supply lines with two shutoff valves/escutcheons on back wall
- Flexible metal conduit (electrical) entering through cabinet floor opening
- Painted cabinet interior; debris and discoloration on base and back panel
- Wall drain stub with cover plate; several unsealed penetrations
- P-trap not fully visible in this photo; configuration not verified

Potential Issues:
- Water stains/discoloration on cabinet base/back panel indicating prior moisture
- Gaps/voids around plumbing and conduit penetrations (wall and floor) – potential pest entry and moisture paths
- Flexible metal conduit passes through rough opening without bushing/strain relief; abrasion hazard and not secured
- Mineral deposits/corrosion at sink strainer/tailpiece connection – possible slow seepage

Recommendations:
- Clean cabinet; run water and monitor all slip-joints/strainer for active leaks; tighten or replace gaskets as needed
- Seal/foam/caulk gaps at wall and floor penetrations; add proper escutcheons where missing
- Have a licensed electrician secure the flexible metal conduit with approved connectors/bushings and terminate in an approved box
- Have a plumber evaluate drain layout and confirm proper P-trap/venting; repair as needed
- Repaint or replace any water-damaged cabinet surfaces after leaks are corrected
