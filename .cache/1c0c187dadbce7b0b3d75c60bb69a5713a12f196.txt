- Exterior wall: Painted vertical wood siding (planks) at foundation level.  
- Condition: Moss/algae growth along bottom edge; weathering cracked boards visible.  
- Clearance/rot risk: Siding appears to sit against concrete pavers; limited clearance, potential moisture intrusion and wood rot.  
- Flashing/trim: Loose or displaced metal flashing piece at base; needs secure reinstallation.  
- Drainage: Paver walkway with gaps; potential water pooling near wall; ensure proper grading and downspout drainage away from foundation.
