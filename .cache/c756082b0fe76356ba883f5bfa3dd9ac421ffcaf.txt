Location:
- Kitchen sink base cabinet (under-sink)

Observations:
- White tubular P-trap with side-inlet branch
- Corrugated gray dishwasher drain hose routed through cabinet back
- Two angle stop shutoff valves with escutcheon plates
- Laminate/vinyl cabinet floor liner
- Visible splash/stain marks on cabinet back panel near base

Potential Issues:
- Water staining on back panel/base suggests past or active leak
- Possible mildew/discoloration on back panel
- Dishwasher drain hose lacks high loop/air gap; hose runs lowâ€”backflow risk
- Oversized/rough hole around hose penetration; gaps/voids expose substrate and potential pest entry
- Missing sealant/trim at penetrations; hose may chafe on raw edge

Recommendations:
- Test plumbing (run sink/disposal/dishwasher) and repair any leaks at trap, branch connection, or valves; replace washers/gaskets as needed
- Clean and dry cabinet; treat/prime stained areas; replace panel if softened/rotted
- Re-route and secure dishwasher drain with a high loop to underside of countertop or install an air gap per local code
- Install a protective grommet/escutcheon and seal around wall penetration to close gaps and prevent abrasion/pest entry
- Monitor with a moisture alarm/pan after repairs
