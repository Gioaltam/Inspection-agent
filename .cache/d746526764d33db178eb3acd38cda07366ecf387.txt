Location:
- Exterior corner post/trim between white panel wall and blue siding at ground level.

Observations:
- Vertical trim shows severe rot and peeling paint with exposed, decayed wood.
- Wood in contact with or near concrete/soil; likely prolonged moisture exposure.
- Algae/mold growth on adjacent white surface; moss at base.
- Debris sacks and miscellaneous items nearby; vegetation at base.

Potential Issues:
- Severe wood rot compromising structural trim/post.
- Possible termite or other wood-destroying insect damage.
- Water intrusion risk at base (gap between wood, siding, and foundation).
- Mold/mildew growth indicating moisture problems.
- Gaps/failed sealant and missing flashing at corner.
- Vegetation/objects creating ongoing moisture trap near wood.

Recommendations:
- Replace rotted trim/post and assess any concealed framing damage.
- Install proper flashing, backer, and sealant; reseal joints.
- Treat/prime and repaint new wood; ensure moisture barriers and proper clearance from soil.
- Inspect interior for water damage or infestation; consult pest/carpenter if needed.
- Improve drainage: re-route downspout, remove debris, trim vegetation away from wall.
