Location:
- Exterior wall, at mini‑split condenser area on gravel

Observations:
- Surface‑mounted weatherproof disconnect on stucco; liquid‑tight whip to unit
- Refrigerant line sets with white foam insulation; bundled with straps
- Exposed black control/communication cable strapped to line set
- Lines looped low and contacting rocks/ground; weeds present

Potential Issues:
- Line‑set insulation UV‑deteriorated with tears/gaps in several areas; potential condensation/efficiency loss
- Gaps/failed sealant around disconnect box where it meets stucco; potential water intrusion into wall/enclosure
- Exposed low‑voltage/control cable not in conduit and susceptible to physical damage
- Line sets resting on rocks/ground—abrasion/damage risk and pest entry path along wall opening if not sealed
- Vegetation and debris near unit can restrict access and airflow

Recommendations:
- Replace/rehabilitate damaged line‑set insulation; consider UV‑resistant line cover
- Seal perimeter of disconnect and any wall penetrations with exterior‑rated sealant
- Protect control wiring in conduit or confirm cable is UV/Outdoor‑rated and secure away from damage
- Support/secure line sets off ground and away from sharp/abrasive surfaces
- Clear vegetation/debris and maintain service clearance
- Have licensed HVAC/electrical contractor evaluate and correct noted items
