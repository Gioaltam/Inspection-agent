Location:
- Exterior first-floor brick wall window assembly; two adjacent white-trimmed windows with blinds.

Observations:
- White painted wood trim around windows; brick sill with white paint.
- Paint on sill and lower trim shows chipping/peeling.
- Small debris on sill; security sticker on left window.

Potential Issues:
- Peeling/chipped paint on trim and sill → potential wood rot if moisture penetrates.
- Unsealed/untreated joint between trim and brick → risk of water intrusion and air leakage.
- No visible interior signs assessed; exterior condition suggests check for hidden rot.

Recommendations:
- Scrape, repair, and repaint affected trim; replace any soft wood or damaged sill.
- Re-seal gaps at brick-to-trim joint with exterior caulk; verify proper flashing/drip edge.
- Inspect interior for moisture staining or rot; address if found.
