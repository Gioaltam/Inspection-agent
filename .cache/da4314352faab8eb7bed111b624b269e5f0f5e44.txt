- Location/materials: Exterior stucco wall around a single metal/aluminum framed window with interior blinds.

- Notable conditions:
  - Hairline stucco cracks around the window opening (top/left area).
  - Caulking around the window frame appears degraded or missing in spots.
  - Window frame finish shows weathering/peeling paint.

- Possible moisture indicators:
  - Darker stain on stucco below the window sill; investigate flashing and drainage at the sill.

- Recommendations:
  - Re-caulk the perimeter with exterior sealant; seal flashing if present.
  - Repaint/protect window frame; monitor for further cracking or moisture intrusion.
