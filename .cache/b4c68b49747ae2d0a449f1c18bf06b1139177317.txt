Location:
- Exterior/entry door to unit hallway; adjacent closet on left; tile floor with welcome mat.

Observations:
- White flush door with peephole; electronic lock device on the door edge and a separate doorknob below.
- White painted door trim; light blue walls; metal threshold at bottom with a small gap to tile.
- Scrapes/scuff marks along lower portion of door; no visible damage to jamb or frame.

Potential Issues:
- Gap at bottom of door/threshold (possible air, water, or pest intrusion).
- No visible weatherstripping at bottom edge (potential energy loss).
- Cosmetic scuffs on lower door surface (not structural).

Recommendations:
- Install or replace door bottom sweep/weatherstripping to seal gap.
- Check door alignment; tighten hinge screws or adjust as needed.
- Seal any visible gaps with appropriate caulk at jamb if necessary.
- Repaint/scuff repair to prevent moisture ingress and improve appearance.
