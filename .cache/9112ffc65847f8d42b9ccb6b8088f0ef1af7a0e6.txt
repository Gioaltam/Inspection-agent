Location:
- Detached single-car garage; right-side/view presents the exterior stucco walls and light blue garage door. Blue tarp covers roof edge and hangs along the side.

Observations:
- Textured stucco exterior, light gray.
- Light blue metal sectional garage door.
- Roof edge/soffit covered with blue tarp; multiple torn panels and loose pieces.
- Tarp debris on ground; no visible gutters/downspouts.
- AC condenser visible near back fence; grassy side yard.

Potential Issues:
- Damaged roof covering; tarp indicates potential leaks and ongoing water intrusion risk.
- Exposed roof deck/underlayment behind tarp; possible missing flashing/sealant.
- Visible stucco cracking/texture irregularities on wall.
- Debris/tripping hazard from loose tarp pieces on ground.
- Likely lack of proper drainage (no visible gutters) increasing water exposure to wall/door.
- Potential pest entry point at tarp gaps.

Recommendations:
- Have roof repaired/replaced; reflash and reseal edges; restore weatherproofing.
- Remove tarp after roofing repair and install proper drip edge/ flashing and gutters.
- Repair stucco cracks and re-seal/paint as needed.
- Clean up debris; ensure yard is tidy and tarp remnants are removed.
- Inspect interior for moisture or water damage; address if found.
- Ensure outdoor unit area is clear and protected from moisture.
