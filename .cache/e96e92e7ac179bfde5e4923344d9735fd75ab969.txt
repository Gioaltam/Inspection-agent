Location:
- Bathroom with tub/shower, toilet, and vanity (view from doorway)

Observations:
- Ceramic/porcelain floor tile with grout
- Laminate countertop; particle-board substrate visible at front edge
- Painted vanity cabinet; side panel worn at base
- Shower/tub behind curtain; partial wall cladding at left of tub
- Painted swing door with brass knob; scuffs and paint loss

Potential Issues:
- Countertop laminate missing/delaminated; substrate exposure and apparent swelling/warping at edge
- Vanity side/bottom deterioration; possible moisture damage
- Staining and deterioration at tub corner wall/trim; potential water intrusion from splash zone
- Gaps/voids at wall/floor and tub corner junction; unsealed
- Likely failed/missing caulk at tub/shower perimeter
- Door surface chipped/peeling; rough edges could splinter/cut
- No trip hazards observed on floor; no corrosion/rust seen; no exposed wiring in view

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair damaged laminate countertop; seal all edges/seams
- Repair/replace deteriorated vanity panels; check for and correct any active leaks
- Clean, dry, and repair tub-corner wall/trim; use moisture-resistant materials/paint
- Re-caulk tub/shower and wall/floor transitions with mildew-resistant sealant; close gaps
- Refinish or replace damaged door; smooth rough edges and repaint
- Inspect plumbing at sink/toilet/tub for leaks; address if found
- Seal/regrout tile as needed; apply grout sealer
- Verify bathroom has functional ventilation (exhaust fan or operable window)
- Confirm receptacles are GFCI-protected
