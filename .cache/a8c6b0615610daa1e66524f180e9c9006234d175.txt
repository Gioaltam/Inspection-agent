Location: HVAC air handler/return filter

What I See: 
- Disposable pleated filter (18 x 20 x 1) is heavily soiled and pleats are starting to bow.

Issues to Address: 
- No repairs needed.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the filter now with the same size; orient airflow arrow toward the blower.
- Ensure a snug fit with no gaps and reinstall the cover/panel.
- Set a reminder to check/replace every 1â€“3 months (more often with pets, dust, or renovations).
