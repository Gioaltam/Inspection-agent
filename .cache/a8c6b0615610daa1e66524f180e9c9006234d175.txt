Location: HVAC/furnace air handler – return filter

What I See:
- Pleated filter (18×20×1) is heavily loaded with dust.
- Some pleats look bowed, indicating airflow restriction.

Issues to Address:
- Clogged/overdue air filter reducing airflow and stressing the HVAC system.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the filter now with a new 18×20×1 (use appropriate MERV rating; 8–11 is typical for homes).
- Install with airflow arrow toward the blower and ensure a snug fit to avoid bypass.
- Set a schedule to check/replace every 1–3 months; clean any dust in the filter rack/cabinet.
