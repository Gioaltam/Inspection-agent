Location:
- Under-sink cabinet (lavatory or kitchen)

Observations:
- White plastic corrugated/accordion tailpiece to tubular P-trap
- Braided stainless supply lines to angle stop valves with escutcheons
- Cabinet back panel roughly cut around pipe penetrations
- Stored fabrics/items in contact with plumbing components

Potential Issues:
- Corrugated tailpiece prone to debris buildup; often not code-compliant
- Mineral staining at tailpiece folds and slip-nut area—suggests past/possible active leak
- Gaps/voids at wall/cabinet penetrations; missing/failed sealant
- Minor corrosion/mineral deposits at right valve/escutcheon—possible seepage
- Misalignment indicated by use of flexible tailpiece
- Storage crowding may hide leaks and block quick access to shutoff valves
- Exposed/unfinished cabinet substrate at cutouts—moisture damage risk and pest entry point

Recommendations:
- Replace corrugated tailpiece with smooth rigid tailpiece; properly align and secure trap
- Inspect and tighten or replace slip-joint washers; leak-test and clean deposits
- Evaluate angle stop valves and braided hoses; replace if leaking/corroded; verify shutoff operation
- Seal/cover wall and cabinet penetrations with escutcheons and caulk/foam; seal raw edges
- Clear and keep area dry; remove absorbent items; consider drip tray or leak sensor
- Monitor after repairs for any signs of renewed leakage
