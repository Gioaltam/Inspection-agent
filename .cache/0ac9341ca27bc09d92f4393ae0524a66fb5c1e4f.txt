Location: Stairway handrail

What I See:
- Handrail bracket at the wall is pulled away; cover plate is not seated.
- Minor cracking/indentation in drywall around the mount.

Issues to Address:
- Loose handrail bracket.
- Local drywall damage at the mounting point.

Recommended Action:
- Remove the cover plate and resecure the bracket into solid framing using appropriate 2.5–3 in. screws. If no stud is available, install rated heavy‑duty toggle/anchor or add blocking, then refasten.
- Replace any stripped fasteners and the escutcheon if bent.
- Patch, sand, prime, and paint the damaged drywall after the bracket is secure.
- Check all other brackets along the rail for tightness and adequate support.
