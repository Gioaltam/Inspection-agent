Location: Stair handrail

What I See:
- Handrail bracket/escutcheon is pulled away from the wall with a visible gap.
- Minor scuffing/drywall damage around the mount.

Issues to Address:
- Loose handrail bracket (potential safety hazard).
- Minor drywall damage at mounting point.

Recommended Action:
- Remove the cover and re-secure the bracket into solid framing with appropriately long screws (or relocate to a stud). If a stud isn’t available, use heavy‑duty toggle anchors rated for handrails.
- Tighten all fasteners and test for firmness; inspect the other brackets as well.
- Patch and touch up the damaged drywall/paint around the mount.
