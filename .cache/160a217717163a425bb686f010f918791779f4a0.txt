Location:
- Whole property per notes: front door, interior floors (except kitchen), garage window, various windows, yard, bathroom

Observations:
- Photo of a “Quarterly Rental Home Inspection Checklist” with handwritten notes
- Notes list: front door rotten; floors rotten (not in kitchen); garage window missing
- Additional notes: house clean; some windows without screens; front lawn OK; backyard grass a bit tall; fence OK; toilet needs to be installed

Potential Issues:
- Wood rot at front door (decay/weakness; weather/security risk)
- Wood rot in flooring (except kitchen) — possible structural weakness/trip hazard
- Garage window missing — open gap/void allowing water intrusion and pest/unauthorized entry
- Some windows lack screens — pest entry points
- Toilet not installed — sanitation concern; open drain may allow sewer gas
- Backyard grass tall — pest harborage

Recommendations:
- Replace rotten front door; check/repair threshold and frame; weather-seal
- Have a licensed contractor evaluate flooring/subfloor; replace damaged areas; investigate and correct moisture source; dry/treat as needed
- Install/repair garage window with proper glazing, flashing, and sealant
- Install/repair window screens where missing
- Install toilet with new wax ring, supply/shutoff; cap drain until installed; test for leaks
- Mow and maintain rear yard; remove harborage
- Reinspect after repairs for moisture, rot, and pest activity
