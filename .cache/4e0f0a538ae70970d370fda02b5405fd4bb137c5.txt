Location:
- Exterior side yard at wall corner; near hose bib and siding

Observations:
- Horizontal lap siding with multiple penetrations (hose bib, pipes, cables)
- Propane cylinder on bare soil under table; surface rust; valve cap missing
- Hose bib/piping heavily corroded; mineral staining on siding below
- Gaps around pipe/wire penetrations; a few open fastener holes in siding
- Loose/unsecured exterior cables/wires hanging; no conduit/protection
- Debris, vegetation, and stacked materials against wall
- Damaged round cap/fixture at ground near wall (looks like broken cleanout)
- Bottom siding close to soil in spots

Potential Issues:
- Corroded hose bib/piping and staining indicate possible active leak; risk of failure
- Unsealed penetrations and holes—water intrusion and pest entry points
- Propane cylinder corroded, on soil, and crowded by combustibles—tip/impact hazard and accelerated corrosion; gas accumulation risk if leaking
- Missing valve dust cap on cylinder—contamination; condition unknown
- Exposed/unsecured wiring/cable—mechanical damage risk; not weather-protected; trip hazard
- Damaged ground cap/fixture—trip hazard and potential pest entry
- Debris/vegetation against siding—moisture retention and pest harborage
- Low siding-to-grade clearance—moisture/wicking risk

Recommendations:
- Have a licensed plumber evaluate/replace corroded hose bib and piping; check for leaks; add vacuum-breaker; repair any water-damaged areas
- Seal all wall penetrations and unused holes with exterior-rated sealant/escutcheons; repair siding as needed; maintain 6–8 in clearance from soil
- Relocate and properly store propane cylinder: upright on stable non-combustible pad, clear of building openings/ignition and combustibles; have propane supplier inspect/recertify or replace; install valve cap
- Secure/terminate or remove unused exterior cables; install in proper conduit/boxes as required (qualified electrician/technician)
- Replace or properly cap the damaged ground cleanout/fixture (appropriate trade)
- Remove debris and vegetation; clean and grade area to shed water; eliminate trip hazards
