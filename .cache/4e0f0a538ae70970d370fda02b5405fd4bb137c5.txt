Location:
- Exterior side wall/ground corner near hose bib

Observations:
- Horizontal lap siding; multiple wall penetrations (spigot/pipes, cables)
- Hose bib and exposed piping heavily corroded/oxidized
- Loose/unprotected low‑voltage cable/cords on wall
- Propane cylinder stored on soil against siding; surface rust present
- Uncapped/abandoned pipe or fitting at grade; rusted
- Gaps around pipe/cable penetrations; sealant absent/deteriorated
- Vegetation and debris/trash present; glass/clear panel lying on ground
- Access to spigot area partially obstructed by items and clutter

Potential Issues:
- Gaps/voids at penetrations and missing/failed caulk—water intrusion and pest entry risk
- Corrosion/rust on hose bib/piping—potential leak/failure
- Propane cylinder rusting and stored against structure on unstable base—impact/ignition/ventilation safety concern
- Unprotected/loose wiring/cables—susceptible to physical damage (no conduit)
- Uncapped/open pipe at grade—pest entry/water intrusion; trip hazard
- Debris/glass and clutter—trip/cut hazards; blocked/unsafe access to shutoff
- Vegetation/organic debris against siding—moisture/pest conducive condition

Recommendations:
- Clean and clear area; remove debris/glass; trim vegetation; maintain ground-to-siding clearance
- Seal all wall penetrations with exterior-grade sealant; add escutcheon plates; patch any unused holes
- Have a licensed plumber evaluate/replace corroded hose bib/piping and check for leaks; add vacuum breaker
- Relocate/secure propane cylinder: store upright on a stable noncombustible base, away from building openings/ignition sources; replace if corrosion is advanced
- Secure/protect low-voltage cables in proper conduit/clips; remove abandoned lines
- Cap or properly terminate any open/abandoned pipe or conduit with a weather/rodent-proof cap
- Touch up paint/finish after sealing to protect siding surfaces
