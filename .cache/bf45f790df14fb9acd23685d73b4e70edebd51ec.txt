Location:
- Exterior wall, ground-level window in stucco facade

Observations:
- Aluminum-framed multi-lite window set in textured stucco
- Perimeter shows old/irregular caulk bead, especially along head and upper corners
- Stucco staining/discoloration above and right of window
- No visible exterior head flashing/drip cap above opening

Potential Issues:
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk at perimeter; visible gaps/voids at top and corners
- Stucco cracking/separation at window-to-stucco interface
- Water staining on stucco suggests past moisture exposure
- Possible window racking/misalignment (frame appears out of square)
- Potential pest entry points at perimeter gaps
- Head flashing/drip cap not visible; possible missing flashing

Recommendations:
- Remove and replace deteriorated caulk; backer rod and high-quality exterior sealant
- Patch and seal stucco cracks; feather and repaint to protect substrate
- Install/verify proper head flashing/drip edge above window
- Check window for square and smooth operation; adjust or replace if racked
- Clean stained areas and monitor after rain for active leaks
