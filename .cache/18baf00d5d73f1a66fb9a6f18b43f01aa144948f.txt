Location:
- Interior 6‑panel door, latch/knob side

Observations:
- Painted door with brass knob/deadlatch
- Heavy dark smudges/soot-like staining across panels and around knob
- Multiple surface scuffs/scratches in paint
- Visible vertical gap along latch side of door-to-jamb reveal (appears larger/uneven)

Potential Issues:
- Unsanitary surface contamination; possible soot residue impacting indoor air quality
- Finish deterioration; embedded grime in porous paint
- Possible door misalignment or poor seal at latch side; potential air/pest infiltration (if exterior) and reduced security/privacy

Recommendations:
- Clean and disinfect door surface; if soot suspected, use appropriate smoke/soot remediation methods (HEPA vacuum, dry‑chem sponge, detergent wipe)
- Repaint/refinish after thorough cleaning and drying; repair scuffs as needed
- Adjust hinges/strike plate to correct reveal; install/replace weatherstripping if this is an exterior/garage door
- If soot source unknown, inspect for combustion byproducts (fireplace, candles, furnace backdrafting); service HVAC/appliances and replace filters; verify CO alarms are present and functional
