Location:
- Exterior ground-mounted A/C condenser (outdoor unit)

Observations:
- Metal cabinet with vertical grille over condenser fins
- Data plate visible (R-410A; model NXA430GKC101)
- Fins show dust/debris accumulation
- Vegetation/weeds contacting grille and lower coil
- Brown low-voltage cable visible at base without protective conduit
- Fasteners present; cabinet shows no obvious rust

Potential Issues:
- Blocked airflow from vegetation/debris against coil
- Dirty/clogged condenser fins reducing heat transfer
- Localized bent/flattened fins at lower section
- Exposed low-voltage control wiring lacks conduit; vulnerable to damage
- Organic debris at base may attract pests/retain moisture

Recommendations:
- Clear vegetation/debris; maintain ~18â€“24 in clearance around and above unit
- Clean condenser coil (gentle rinse/fin brush or professional service)
- Straighten bent fins with a fin comb where accessible
- Install protective conduit/strain relief for low-voltage wiring; secure properly
- Have HVAC technician service unit after cleaning to confirm proper operation and amperage/pressures
