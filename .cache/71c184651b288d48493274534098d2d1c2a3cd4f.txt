Location:
- Exterior; outdoor A/C condensing unit

Observations:
- R-410A condenser; data plate visible (NXA4 series)
- Metal cabinet with vertical grille over finned coil
- Vegetation/debris contacting lower coil
- Coil shows dirt accumulation; scattered bent/matted fins
- Electrical/refrigerant entries at lower right (partially visible)
- Label notes “Installation Prohibited in Southwest”

Potential Issues:
- Blocked airflow from vegetation/debris against coil
- Bent/matted fins reducing heat transfer
- Compliance concern if property is in the Southwest (per label)
- No visible corrosion, leaks, cracks, gaps, loose fasteners, or exposed wiring in view

Recommendations:
- Remove vegetation/debris; maintain 12–24 in. clearance around unit
- Clean condenser coil with appropriate low‑pressure/coil cleaner; straighten fins with a fin comb
- Consider gravel/weed barrier around pad to prevent regrowth
- If located in the Southwest, have HVAC contractor verify code/efficiency compliance for this model
- Schedule routine HVAC service to confirm charge and operation
