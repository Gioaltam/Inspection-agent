Location:
- Front exterior entry ramp, door threshold, adjacent siding

Observations:
- Wood ramp with painted plank decking; two wood guardrails
- Paint/finish heavily worn; bare wood exposed
- Deck boards show splits, cupping, and surface deterioration
- Vegetation overgrowing edges and through board gaps
- Rail joints show weathering; some fasteners visibly rusted
- Small entry landing at door; clutter present
- Vinyl siding near right window with green algae/mildew staining

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/splits and warping/cupping in ramp boards
- Gaps/separations between boards; vegetation encroaching through gaps
- Substrate exposure from failed paint/finish; moisture vulnerability
- Splintered/broken board edges; uneven surfaces = trip/fall hazard
- Corrosion/rust on rail fasteners; possible weakening of connections
- Rail misalignment and open-rail design; large openings increase fall risk, especially for children
- Blocked/unsafe conditions: clutter at landing narrows path
- Mold/mildew staining on siding
- No visible electrical issues; no obvious pest entry points observed

Recommendations:
- Replace damaged/splintered and significantly warped deck boards; re-secure loose members
- Replace corroded fasteners; reinforce/rebuild railings for rigidity; add compliant, graspable handrail and guard infill/balusters as needed
- Prep and refinish all wood with exterior-grade, non-slip coating to protect exposed substrate
- Remove clutter from landing; trim vegetation and clear growth from/under ramp; add weed barrier
- Inspect underlying framing/posts for hidden rot; repair/replace as needed
- Clean siding and treat mildew; monitor for recurring moisture issues
- Improve lighting/visibility at ramp and threshold for safety
