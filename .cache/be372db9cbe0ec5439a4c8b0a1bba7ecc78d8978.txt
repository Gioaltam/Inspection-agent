Location:
- Exterior front entry; wood access ramp and small landing at door; adjacent siding

Observations:
- Wood-framed, painted ramp with handrails both sides
- Paint heavily weathered/peeling; bare wood exposed
- Deck boards cupped/checked; uneven wear; end gaps visible
- Top rails split/cracked; rough surfaces
- Visible rust staining at some fasteners on rails
- Vegetation growing along/through ramp edges
- Small landing at door with threshold lip
- Siding near ramp shows green algae/mildew staining

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/splitting in rails and decking; splinter and failure risk
- Warped/cupped boards and uneven surfaces; trip hazard
- Failed/missing sealant/paint with exposed substrate; moisture intrusion/wood decay likely
- Corroded fasteners; potential weakening of rail connections
- Gaps/separations at board joints; snag/trip points
- Vegetation encroachment; slip/trip hazard and retains moisture/pests
- Possible misalignment/leaning rails/posts; reduced guard stability
- Algae/mildew on siding and possibly ramp; slippery when wet
- Threshold lip at door; trip hazard

Recommendations:
- Have a qualified contractor evaluate ramp and rails; replace any rotted/split/warped boards and compromised posts/rails
- Remove/replace corroded fasteners with exterior-rated screws/bolts; resecure all connections
- Sand or replace splintered surfaces; add non-skid strips/coating
- Prep and apply exterior wood preservative/primer and paint/stain; seal end-grain
- Trim/clear vegetation; maintain clearance and drainage beneath/around ramp
- Clean algae/mildew from siding and ramp with appropriate cleaner; monitor for recurring moisture
- Verify a level landing and smooth door transition; modify to eliminate threshold trip lip if needed
