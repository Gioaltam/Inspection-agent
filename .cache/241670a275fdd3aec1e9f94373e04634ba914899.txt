Location:
- Exterior side elevation under gable/eave; window, telecom lines, and gas riser

Observations:
- Stucco exterior; painted
- Single-hung window with painted trim/sill
- Wood soffit/fascia; horizontal siding at gable
- Telecom/low-voltage box with multiple cables; wires pass through soffit and wall
- Gas riser/shutoff near grade; foundation vent nearby

Potential Issues:
- Loose/dangling low-voltage cables; unsecured/exposed; potential snag/trip hazard
- Unsealed wire penetrations at soffit and wall; potential water intrusion and pest entry points
- Soffit/fascia corner shows water stains/discoloration; possible leak; rot/mold risk
- Stucco with hairline cracks, localized spalls, and peeling paint; moisture-intrusion risk
- Window perimeter caulk/paint deteriorated; small gaps/voids at trim/sill
- Gas piping with surface corrosion; exposed to potential impact
- Minor cracks/deterioration at foundation/parge near grade/vent

Recommendations:
- Have qualified low-voltage contractor remove abandoned lines, properly secure/route active cables, and terminate; add protection/conduit where subject to damage
- Seal all exterior penetrations with exterior-grade sealant; install bushings/escutcheons
- Investigate source of soffit staining; repair any roof/eave deficiencies; replace/repair damaged wood; prime/paint
- Repair stucco cracks/spalls; scrape/prime/repaint to maintain weather barrier
- Re-caulk and paint window perimeter; repair any damaged trim; verify proper operation/weathersealing
- Clean/treat and coat gas piping to inhibit rust; add impact protection if needed; have licensed plumber/utility inspect if concerns persist
- Patch foundation parge and ensure vent screen is intact and secure
