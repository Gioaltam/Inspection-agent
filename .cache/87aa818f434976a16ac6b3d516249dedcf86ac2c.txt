Location:
- Exterior metal storage sheds in backyard, two adjacent units with double doors; standing in overgrown vegetation.

Observations:
- White metal panels show widespread surface rust/oxidation and paint weathering.
- Doors appear misaligned with bottom edge bending; visible gaps at joints; padlock/hasp in place.
- Ground clearance low; tall weeds/grasses at base; no visible foundation or isolation from soil.
- Roof edge shows rust; no visible gutters or flashing from this angle.

Potential Issues:
- Severe surface rust may indicate structural thinning of panels.
- Door misalignment and damaged bottom edge; potential weather sealing failure and security risk.
- Gaps around doors and frame; possible water intrusion and pest entry.
- Vegetation in contact with metal; moisture retention could accelerate corrosion.
- Lack of visible foundation could allow uplift or movement in high winds.

Recommendations:
- Treat and repaint rusted areas; assess panel thickness and replace severely corroded sections if needed.
- Realign doors; repair or replace bottom hinges/straps; install weatherstripping and door sweeps; reseal frame with appropriate caulk.
- Remove vegetation at base; install a stable base/pedestal or concrete pad; ensure clear drainage away from sheds.
- Inspect interior for moisture, leaks, or mold; address any found promptly.
- Implement ongoing maintenance to prevent future rust (clean, coat, and inspect annually).
