Location:
- Exterior soffit area under the eave above the entry, adjacent to landscaped palms.

Observations:
- White perforated aluminum soffit panels appear intact.
- Fascia/trim along edge shows light paint wear but no obvious deformation.
- Palm plants are growing close to and partly over the eave.
- A conduit/cable runs along the wall near the vent area and appears loosely secured.

Potential Issues:
- Plant contact and accumulated debris can trap moisture, risk rot/corrosion, and attract pests.
- Possible gaps/sealant deterioration at the wall-to-soffit junction (water intrusion risk).
- Unsecured conduit/wiring exposed to weather (safety/code concern).

Recommendations:
- Trim back/remove vegetation contacts; maintain clearance from structure.
- Inspect and reseal any joints between wall and soffit with exterior-grade sealant as needed.
- Secure and weatherproof conduit; use proper clamps/weatherproof fittings.
- Clean debris from under the soffit and ensure perforations remain unobstructed.
- Monitor after rain for any signs of water intrusion or staining.
