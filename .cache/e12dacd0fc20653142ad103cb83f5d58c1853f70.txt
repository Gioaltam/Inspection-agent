Location:
- Exterior side yard, against blue lap siding; outdoor A/C condenser on concrete pad

Observations:
- Tempstar condensing unit with vertical wire grille and top fan guard
- Plastic/cloth top cover strapped over fan guard
- Coils visibly dusty; some bent fins low on face
- Vegetation/tall grass around pad
- PVC vent termination immediately right of unit
- Rear/right sides close to walls/structure
- Pad corner chipped; unit appears mostly level
- Electrical whip/disconnect not visible from this view

Potential Issues:
- Dirty/clogged condenser fins restricting airflow
- Vegetation encroachment blocking airflow
- Top cover could block airflow/overheat unit if operated covered
- Limited side/rear clearance to walls may not meet manufacturer specs
- Bent/damaged fins at lower coil sections
- Service disconnect not visible; if absent/out of sight, safety/code concern
- Chipped pad corner; potential instability if deterioration progresses
- Nearby vent may discharge heat/lint toward condenser, causing fouling

Recommendations:
- Remove any cover before operation; only use for off‑season
- Clean coils; straighten fins; schedule HVAC service
- Cut back vegetation and maintain 12–24 in. side and clear top clearance
- Verify required clearances; modify surroundings/relocate if inadequate
- Confirm a code‑compliant service disconnect is present within sight; install if missing
- Monitor/repair/replace pad if settling or instability observed
- Identify adjacent vent; if dryer exhaust, reroute or add deflector to reduce lint to coils
