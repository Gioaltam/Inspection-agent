Location:
- Exterior side yard; condenser set on concrete pad beside house siding

Observations:
- Tempstar outdoor A/C condenser; wire-guarded coil and top fan
- Pad at grade with grass/vegetation around base
- Coil shows dirt buildup and scattered bent fins
- Very close to house wall and adjacent plastic structure
- Metal vertical chase/flashing on wall with visible open seam
- Electrical disconnect/line set not visible from this angle

Potential Issues:
- Inadequate side clearance to walls/structure; restricted airflow and service access
- Bent/creased coil fins and dirty coil; reduced efficiency/overheating risk
- Vegetation contacting unit; blockage and corrosion/moisture retention risk
- Open seam/gap at adjacent metal chase to siding; potential water intrusion/pest entry
- Top panel appears weathered/warped; may allow water entry at shroud over time

Recommendations:
- Reposition or shift unit to provide manufacturer-required clearances (typically 12â€“24 in. sides, ~60 in. above)
- Clean condenser coils; carefully straighten fins; schedule HVAC service
- Cut back and maintain vegetation clearance; consider gravel border around pad
- Seal/flash the metal chase-to-siding seam with exterior-rated sealant/flashing
- Verify pad is sound and level; re-level if settlement is present
- Have licensed HVAC technician evaluate overall condition and confirm proper electrical disconnect and insulated line set are present and serviceable
