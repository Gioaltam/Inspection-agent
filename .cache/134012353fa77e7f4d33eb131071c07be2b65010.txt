Location: Ceiling fan/light â€“ room ceiling

What I See:
- Several fan blades are bent/warped with peeling/delaminating edges.
- Light kit/globe is missing; bare bulb in socket.

Issues to Address:
- Damaged fan blades (warped/delaminated, chipped).
- Missing light globe/shade (likely missing retaining hardware as well).

Recommended Action:
- Replace the entire fan, or at minimum replace all blades with a matching set and balance the unit; avoid using at high speed until repaired.
- Install the correct light globe and hardware for the fixture.
- While servicing, verify the fan is securely mounted and wiring connections are sound.
