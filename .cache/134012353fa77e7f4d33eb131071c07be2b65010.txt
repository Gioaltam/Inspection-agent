Location: Ceiling fan/light fixture

What I See:
- Fan blades are bent/warped with peeling paint and heavy dust buildup.
- Light kit is missing a globe/shade; bare bulb exposed.

Issues to Address:
- Warped/damaged blades (likely out of balance; wobble/safety risk).
- Missing light globe/shade.
- Excess dust accumulation on motor and blades.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the fan, or at minimum replace all blades as a matched set, tighten hardware, and balance the fan.
- Install a compatible light globe or replace the light kit; use a bulb within the fixtureâ€™s rated wattage.
- Clean the unit thoroughly; verify the fan is secured to a fan-rated electrical box and test on all speeds.
