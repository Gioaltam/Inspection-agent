Location:
- Ceiling HVAC register/grille

Observations:
- White painted metal louvered grille; two mounting screws
- Textured drywall ceiling; no discoloration around register
- Visible adjustable damper behind louvers
- Light to moderate dust buildup on louvers and damper
- Slight bend noted on lower louver

Potential Issues:
- Dust accumulation may restrict airflow and distribute particulates
- Minor bend on lower louver
- No visible gaps/separations at perimeter, failed sealant, corrosion/rust, water stains/leaks, mold/mildew, loose/missing fasteners, or other hazards

Recommendations:
- Clean grille and damper (vacuum/brush; wipe with mild cleaner)
- Check/replace HVAC air filter; consider duct cleaning if dust returns quickly
- Gently straighten or replace grille if airflow or noise is affected
- Verify screws are snug and register sits flush; seal any detected perimeter air leaks with appropriate caulk if present
