Location:
- Interior ceiling HVAC register/grille (exact room not specified)

Observations:
- Rectangular metal grille with horizontal louvers; ceiling-mounted
- Secured with side screws; paint generally intact
- Noticeable dust on louvers and inside duct throat
- Slight visible gap/shadow at register-to-ceiling perimeter; no caulk/gasket seen

Potential Issues:
- Dust/debris buildup on grille/duct throat reducing airflow and indoor air quality
- Minor perimeter gap may allow air leakage and dust streaking
- Possible slight bend/deflection at lower louver (cosmetic)
- No visible water stains, corrosion, cracks, missing fasteners, or mold

Recommendations:
- Clean grille and accessible duct throat (vacuum/brush)
- Replace/upgrade HVAC filter; verify correct fit and service interval
- Seal register-to-ceiling perimeter with paintable caulk or gasket; verify boot/duct joints are sealed with mastic/foil tape
- If similar dust seen at multiple registers, schedule HVAC/duct inspection and cleaning
- Straighten or replace bent louver if airflow is affected
