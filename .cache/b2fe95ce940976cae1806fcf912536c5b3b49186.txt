Location:
- Exterior, backyard wood privacy fence and gate adjacent to house

Observations:
- Vertical wood pickets on wood frame; black metal latch/hinge hardware
- Weathered, unstained/untreated wood; multiple knot holes
- Uneven bottom clearance at soil/grass

Potential Issues:
- Warping/cupping of several pickets
- Gap/separation at gate-to-fence meeting edge; daylight visible
- Gate/latch area appears misaligned; strike and latch offset
- One edge picket on gate bowed/loose at bottom
- Cracks and knot voids in several boards
- Unsealed/weathered wood surfaces (finish failed)
- Potential pest entry points through gaps/voids

Recommendations:
- Adjust/realign gate and latch so hardware engages properly
- Re-secure or replace loose/bowed pickets; replace boards with major cracks/voids
- Inspect and tighten/replace fasteners as needed
- Clean and apply exterior-grade stain/sealant to all wood surfaces
- Maintain clearance at grade; keep vegetation trimmed away from fence
