Location: Yard/side area

What I See:
- Broken concrete slab with scattered rubble and some charred material.
- Loose/damaged wooden panels (one looks like a louvered door) lying on the ground.

Issues to Address:
- Concrete pad is shattered.
- Wood paneling is damaged and discarded.
- Debris creates trip and injury hazards.

Recommended Action:
- Remove and properly dispose of all concrete and wood debris; use PPE and watch for nails/screws.
- If the slab previously supported equipment or a walkway, replace/rebuild to code; otherwise remove remaining fragments and restore grade.
- Rake/level area and reseed or cover to prevent erosion and pests.
