Location: Yard â€“ ground area

What I See:
- Pile of debris: broken concrete/masonry pieces with charred/deteriorated wood panels.
- Evidence of prior burn/heat damage on materials.

Issues to Address:
- Concrete slab is broken and fragmented.
- Burned/charred debris present.
- Trip and injury hazard from loose rubble, nails/screws, and cinder block pieces.

Recommended Action:
- Remove and properly dispose of all loose rubble and burned materials; rake area clean.
- If this was a pad for equipment or a walkway, plan to pour a new concrete pad or restore grade as needed.
- Check for any buried utilities before excavation/haul-off.
- After cleanup, backfill/level soil to eliminate trip hazards and seed/sod for erosion control.
