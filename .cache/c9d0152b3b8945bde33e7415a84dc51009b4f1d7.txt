Location:
- Inspection checklist document on clipboard (general property notes)

Observations:
- “Quarterly Rental Home Inspection Checklist” with handwritten notes (Portuguese)
- Notes mention: dishwasher intermittent and water backs up; leak at kitchen sink; A/C filter; missing living room blinds; sprinkler spraying water toward/into living room; “janela” (window) referenced

Potential Issues:
- Dishwasher operates intermittently; water backing up into sink (drain/air-gap issue; overflow risk)
- Leak at kitchen sink (water intrusion; mold/mildew risk)
- HVAC filter likely dirty/missing (reduced airflow; equipment strain)
- Living room blinds missing (missing parts)
- Irrigation sprinkler aimed at/into living room area or wall (water intrusion/damage risk)

Recommendations:
- Have an appliance technician diagnose dishwasher; verify/repair drain line, high loop/air gap, pump/check valve
- Repair plumbing leak at sink; dry and inspect cabinet/walls for moisture damage or mold; seal as needed
- Replace/clean HVAC filter; confirm correct size and installation
- Install/repair living room blinds
- Adjust/repair sprinkler heads and timers to direct water away from structure; inspect exterior wall/window for signs of past intrusion
