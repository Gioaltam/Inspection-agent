Location:
- Bathtub/shower base floor, bathroom

Observations:
- Fiberglass/acrylic pan with round metal drain
- Widespread surface wear/etching and discoloration; mottled/peeling finish
- Light scuffs/scratches; minor surface staining
- No standing water observed; drain cover in place

Potential Issues:
- Finish/gelcoat deterioration with areas of coating loss; possible substrate exposure
- Staining and possible mildew spotting on pan surface
- Smooth/worn areas may become slippery when wet (fall hazard)

Recommendations:
- Deep-clean with non‑abrasive cleaner; treat any mildew
- Refinish/reglaze pan or replace if finish is worn through to substrate
- Add temporary slip‑resistant decals/mat until repaired
- Monitor around drain for seepage; reseal/replace drain gasket if leaks are noted
- Improve bathroom ventilation to reduce moisture buildup
