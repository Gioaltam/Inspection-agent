Location:
- Shower/tub basin floor near drain

Observations:
- Fiberglass/acrylic surface with drain strainer
- Extensive surface discoloration and etching; mottled gray/white areas
- Light surface scuffs/scratches; water spots/mineral film visible

Potential Issues:
- Finish/gelcoat deterioration; possible substrate exposure in worn patches
- Staining/mineral buildup indicates hard-water deposits
- Smooth/worn areas may increase slip hazard
- No visible cracks, gaps, loose parts, or rust at drain in this view

Recommendations:
- Deep clean with non-abrasive cleaner/descaler; remove mineral deposits
- Refinish/reglaze or resurface shower base if finish failure confirmed; consider liner or replacement if wear is through to substrate
- Inspect and reseal around drain if any gap/leak is found during closer evaluation
- Improve ventilation and consider water softening to reduce future deposits; maintain regular cleaning
