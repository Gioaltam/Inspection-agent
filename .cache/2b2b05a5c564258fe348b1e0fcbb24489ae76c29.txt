Location:
- HVAC return/air handler cabinet in utility area (near furnace). Filter access front panel.

Observations:
- 14x18x1 pleated filter appears dirty and not fully seated (sloped/tilted).
- Return plenum interior dusty; bottom tray area dark/stained.
- Copper refrigerant line(s) with insulation on right side; lines appear close to cabinet.
- Wires/cables loosely on floor and not protected; some run along wood surface.
- Wood base under unit shows staining/spots; possible moisture exposure.

Potential Issues:
- Dirty, mis-seated filter may reduce airflow and lift strain on system.
- Moisture staining on wood suggests condensation or leaks; potential mold/rot risk.
- Unsecured wiring/cables near floor; electrical hazard potential.
- Exposed/loosely routed refrigerant lines insulation may be compromised.
- Trip hazard from cables lying across walking area.

Recommendations:
- Replace filter with correct size and ensure it sits flush; reseat properly.
- Inspect condensate pan/drain for clogs or leaks; address any moisture source.
- Assess wood surface for water damage; dry/repair as needed; monitor for mold.
- Secure and route electrical cables; use proper conduit or fasteners; keep away from moisture.
- Inspect refrigerant lines for insulation and mounting; tighten/secure as needed; call HVAC tech if leak suspected.
- Clean inside of cabinet and verify seals around return opening to prevent air bypass.
