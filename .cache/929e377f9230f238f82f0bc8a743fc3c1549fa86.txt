Location:
- Exterior window sill area, bottom edge of window opening.

Observations:
- Aluminum window frame with weathered finish; bottom track shows staining.
- Red-painted sill/ ledge surface with dirt, small chips, and some paint wear.
- White electrical cable lying unsecured along the sill, with a noticeable bend.
- No visible sealant/caulk at the joint between window frame and sill in photo; signs of minor surface staining.

Potential Issues:
- Exposed exterior electrical cable on the sill (trip hazard and moisture exposure risk).
- Paint/chip wear and surface staining on the sill; possible substrate exposure.
- Possible gaps or deteriorated sealant at the window-sill joint (potential water intrusion risk).
- Rust or corrosion indicators on metal frame slightly apparent.

Recommendations:
- Secure or relocate the cable; run in exterior-rated conduit or proper channeling; ensure electrical compliance.
- Clean the sill and inspect for substrate damage; repair/replace damaged area; reseal joints with exterior caulk.
- Inspect window frame and sill for moisture intrusion; re-caulk and, if needed, address flashing/drip edge to promote drainage.
- If substrate is wood, check for rot and replace damaged sections; if metal, treat rust and repaint.
