Location: Front yard / main entry walkway

What I See:
- Stepping-stone walkway is uneven with some sunken/misaligned pavers.
- Landscaping is overgrown near the entry.

Issues to Address:
- Trip hazard from uneven/sunken walkway pavers.

Recommended Action:
- Lift pavers, regrade and compact the base, then reset or replace damaged pieces; add edging and sand to lock in place. Consider replacing with a continuous concrete walk for longâ€‘term durability.
