Location: Front exterior/yard

What I See:
- Brick fa√ßade, porch, and roof shingles look intact with no visible damage.
- Landscaping is overgrown and encroaching on the entry path.

Issues to Address:
- No repairs needed.

Recommended Action:
- No repair work required. For routine maintenance, mow/edge the lawn and trim shrubs to keep the walkway clear.
