Location:
- Under kitchen sink; PVC P-trap drain visible.

Observations:
- White PVC trap with slip-joint nuts.
- Left-side small-diameter pipe has an improvised repair using a hose/clamp fitting.
- Wall behind shows brown staining suggesting past moisture.
- No active puddling seen in photo; cabinet floor appears dry.

Potential Issues:
- Improvised clamp repair on drain (leak risk; not a proper PVC connection).
- Past moisture staining on wall (possible hidden leak or ongoing issue).
- Possible lack of proper support/fastening for the drain assembly (may sag over time).

Recommendations:
- Replace the improvised clamp with proper PVC fittings (compression or solvent-welded) or a manufacturer-approved repair coupling.
- Inspect and repair wall/drywall behind cabinet; address any moisture source and dry out.
- Perform a water test for leaks after repair; tighten/replace as needed.
- Secure the drain assembly to the cabinet (proper straps/support) to prevent movement.
