Location:
- Furnace/air handler cabinet in a utility closet; lower return air opening visible.

Observations:
- 18x18x1 filter box present; filter appears not fully seated or is still in packaging box.
- Insulation/board material at right side of opening appears torn or deteriorated.
- Dust/dirt buildup inside the opening and on adjacent surfaces.
- PVC condensate drain lines visible under the unit (no obvious pan seen in view).
- CO hazard warning label on unit (indicates combustion appliance; no active leak detected in photo).

Potential Issues:
- Unseated or missing filter could cause bypass and reduced air quality/efficiency.
- Damaged insulation around return opening may cause air leakage and energy loss.
- Debris/dust buildup in the plenum could affect comfort and IAQ.
- Visible drain lines; no evident secondary pan or overflow protection in view (potential water damage risk if pan/drain fails).
- If gas-fired, CO risk requires proper venting and functioning detectors.

Recommendations:
- Replace with correctly sized 18x18x1 filter and ensure it sits squarely with arrow toward unit.
- Repair or replace torn insulation; seal gaps around the opening.
- Clean the return opening area and inspect for mold or moisture; address as needed.
- Inspect condensate drainage: verify proper slope, clear trap, and confirm a secondary overflow pan/alarm if not present.
- Have a licensed HVAC technician verify unit venting (if gas) and test for CO; install/verify functioning CO detectors.
- Secure access panel and consider a protective cover/draft stop to prevent debris ingress.
