Location: Exterior jalousie window

What I See:
- One glass louver is missing (open hole at lower left).
- Other louvers and frame show dirt buildup.

Issues to Address:
- Missing/broken glass louver creating an opening to the interior.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the missing glass louver with the correct size (tempered glass recommended).
- Inspect and replace any damaged louver clips/operator hardware; clean and lubricate tracks for smooth operation.
- Temporarily cover the opening to prevent water/pest entry until repaired.
- After repair, check perimeter caulking and reseal if gaps are found.
