Location: Exterior jalousie window

What I See:
- One lower glass louver is missing, leaving an open gap.
- Frame and tracks look dirty/worn.

Issues to Address:
- Missing/broken glass louver creating an exterior opening.

Recommended Action:
- Replace the missing louver with the correct size glass and verify the clips/operators hold it securely.
- After replacement, test the mechanism for smooth operation and full closure; repair/replace any damaged clips or operator if needed.
- Clean the tracks and consider recaulking the perimeter if any gaps are found during repair.
