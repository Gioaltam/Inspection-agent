Location:
- Exterior side yard under eave/soffit next to wood fence and landscaping

Observations:
- Vented soffit panels (vinyl/aluminum) with fascia; no gutter visible on this edge
- Light paint/overspray spots on soffit
- Mature shrubs/trees growing up to/into eave area
- Wood privacy fence with weathered tops
- Overhead utility lines visible behind foliage

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting/very close to soffit/eave; potential abrasion, pest bridge, and vent obstruction
- Tree canopy near overhead utility lines; possible contact hazard
- Fence pickets show weathering and splitting at tops; potential splinter/decay; possible instability if fasteners deteriorated

Recommendations:
- Trim trees/shrubs back (keep several feet of clearance from roof/eaves and off the structure)
- Have utility/qualified arborist prune branches near power lines to maintain safe clearance
- Clean soffit vents and remove any paint/debris blocking perforations; verify attic ventilation is unobstructed
- Repair/replace split or deteriorated fence pickets; secure loose fasteners; seal/stain wood for protection
- Consider adding/repairing gutters on this run if drainage control is needed
