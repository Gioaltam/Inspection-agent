Location:
- Exterior side yard, under roof eave/soffit above wood fence; overhead utility lines nearby

Observations:
- Vented vinyl/aluminum soffit and metal/aluminum fascia; no gutter visible
- Mature vegetation/branches reaching to eave area
- Overhead utility lines running along property edge
- Weathered wooden privacy fence

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation contacting/within inches of eave/soffit; pest bridge and abrasion/moisture retention risk
- Branches encroaching near overhead utility lines; shock/fire hazard if contacted, unsafe for owner trimming
- Light biological staining/discoloration on soffit/fascia (possible algae/mildew)
- Fence pickets weathered with cracked/splintered tops; ongoing deterioration/splinter hazard
- No visible dents, bends, warping, gaps/separations, loose/missing soffit parts/fasteners, failed sealant, corrosion, or active leaks

Recommendations:
- Have a qualified arborist/utility coordinate trimming to maintain safe clearance from power lines; prune branches 3â€“5 ft away from roof/eaves
- Clean soffit/fascia; treat for mildew/algae; monitor for recurring moisture
- After trimming, inspect soffit panels for damage/looseness and secure/repair as needed; keep vents unobstructed
- Repair/replace damaged fence pickets and seal/stain wood to protect from weathering
