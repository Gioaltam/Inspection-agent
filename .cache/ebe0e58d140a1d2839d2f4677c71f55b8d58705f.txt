Location:
- Under kitchen sink, garbage disposal connected to sink drain.

Observations:
- Black garbage disposal unit installed.
- Yellow flexible hose connected to the disposal side inlet with a hose clamp.
- White PVC drain pipe runs to the right; likely part of the drain/trap assembly.
- Cabinet clutter and cleaning supplies present; no active leaks visible in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Dishwasher drain connection appears improvised with a clamp on the disposal inlet; potential for leaks and code violation.
- No visible air gap/high loop for dishwasher drain; backflow risk.
- P-trap configuration not clearly visible; potential missing or misaligned trap.
- Electrical/cording for disposal not visible; ensure proper, code-compliant connection (GFCI if required) and strain relief.

Recommendations:
- Have a plumber verify dishwasher drain connection and install proper high loop or air gap per code.
- Confirm a correctly configured P-trap with proper slope; install or repair as needed.
- Inspect connections for signs of leakage; replace clamps/fittings with manufacturer-approved hardware.
- Ensure electrical supply for the disposal is correctly wired and protected.
