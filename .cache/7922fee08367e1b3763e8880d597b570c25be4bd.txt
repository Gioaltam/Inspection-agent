Location:
- Exterior wood siding at base of wall, just above grade/control line.

Observations:
- White painted wood siding with extensive paint cracking and peeling.
- Bottom horizontal trim shows heavy paint flaking and surface cracking.
- Brown staining and dirt/moisture staining along the lower edge.
- Gaps/separation at the bottom edge of siding and trim; visible joint cracking.
- Some small rusty fasteners/nails along the trim.
- Vegetation/debris at base; possible lack of proper flashing or caulk at joint.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected wood rot/decay along bottom siding and trim from moisture exposure.
- Water intrusion risk due to cracks, gaps, and lack of sealant/flashings.
- Deteriorated protective coating (paint) reducing moisture protection.
- Exposed end grain may wick moisture if not sealed.
- Possible pest entry points where wood is softened or gaps exist.

Recommendations:
- Inspect and confirm wood condition; replace any softened/rotted sections.
- Clean, sand, prime, and re-paint; re-caulk joints between siding and trim.
- Seal and install proper flashing; ensure minimum clearance from grade (raise as needed).
- Remove vegetation/debris near foundation to reduce moisture retention.
- Consider a professional rot/termite inspection if deterioration is suspected.
- Recheck after repairs for any interior moisture or mold concerns.
