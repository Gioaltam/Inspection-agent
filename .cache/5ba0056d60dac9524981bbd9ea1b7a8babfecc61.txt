Location:
- Outdoor condenser unit (air conditioner), mounted on the ground near vegetation.

Observations:
- Metal condenser cabinet with manufacturer label (model CAC030AKAA5; serial E031954283).
- Indicates 208/230V, 1-phase, 30 A, refrigerant R-22 (older refrigerant).
- Label appears weathered; minor surface staining/rust possible along lower edge.
- Plant growth and leaves touching/near the top and sides of the unit; debris on top.

Potential Issues:
- Vegetation in contact with unit (top/sides) and debris buildup â†’ airflow restriction and potential service access issues.
- Possible surface rust/damage on lower cabinet edge (not structural from photo, but visible).
- R-22 refrigerant indicated (older system; future servicing/refrigerant replacement considerations).

Recommendations:
- Trim/remove vegetation and maintain at least 12 inches clearance around all sides and above unit.
- Remove leaves/debris from and around the unit; inspect for rust and repair/coat as needed.
- Have a licensed HVAC tech inspect electrical connections and confirm proper service access/disconnect.
- If refrigerant is indeed R-22, plan for future refrigerant phase-out/upgrade per current regulations and equipment life.
