Location: Ceiling air register

What I See:
- Vent cover has visible dust buildup.
- Several center louvers appear bent/deformed.

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged louvers on the register.
- Dust/debris accumulation on the grille.

Recommended Action:
- Remove cover and clean thoroughly (vacuum/soap and water); wipe surrounding area.
- If louvers can’t be straightened or damper doesn’t operate smoothly, replace the register with the same size.
- Replace HVAC filter and monitor; if dust returns quickly, have ducts inspected/cleaned.
