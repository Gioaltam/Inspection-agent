Location: Ceiling HVAC vent/register

What I See:
- Noticeable dust buildup on the grille
- Several center louvers are bent/deformed

Issues to Address:
- Bent/damaged louvers on the register (may restrict airflow)

Recommended Action:
- Replace the register grille (cheap fix) or carefully straighten the bent louvers if reusable
- Clean the vent opening and surrounding surface; vacuum visible dust in the duct
- Check/replace the HVAC filter and monitor for recurring dust buildup
