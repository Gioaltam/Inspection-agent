Location:
- Exterior wall at mini‑split outdoor unit and service disconnect

Observations:
- Mini‑split condenser on small concrete pad over gravel
- Refrigerant line set wrapped with white insulation/tape; several black control/power cables bundled
- Gray flexible conduit and white PVC entering wall; service disconnect mounted adjacent
- Lines and conduit loosely routed with sections resting on/near ground

Potential Issues:
- Refrigerant line insulation visibly deteriorated/torn with gaps; substrate exposure likely
- Multiple wall penetrations around lines/conduits appear unsealed; potential water/pest entry
- Exposed control/electrical cables not fully protected in conduit and loosely secured; risk of UV/mechanical damage; possible code concern
- Flexible conduit lying on ground; abrasion/trip hazard and potential for water intrusion if not liquidtight
- Disconnect enclosure corner dented/chipped paint; potential for corrosion and compromised weather seal

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair UV‑resistant insulation on refrigerant suction line; rewrap line set
- Seal all exterior wall penetrations with appropriate exterior‑grade sealant/escutcheons
- Have licensed HVAC/electrician secure and protect wiring: route in proper conduit with strain relief/connectors; verify disconnect integrity and grounding
- Support/raise conduits and lines off ground; secure to wall to remove trip/abrasion risk
- Repair or replace damaged/discolored disconnect enclosure; repaint to prevent corrosion
- Clear vegetation and maintain service clearance around unit
