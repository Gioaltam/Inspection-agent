Location:
- Interior wall/ceiling surface near an HVAC register (exact room not specified)

Observations:
- Painted, heavily textured (orange-peel/popcorn-like) gypsum drywall
- Widespread paint/texture blistering and peeling
- Multiple areas with coating missing; brown drywall paper exposed
- Minor cracking around peeled edges

Potential Issues:
- Coating delamination/peeling; loose finish
- Substrate exposure (drywall paper visible)
- Gaps/voids in finish; localized surface damage
- Evidence consistent with moisture involvement (possible leak/condensation near vent)
- Risk of mold if moisture persists (none clearly visible in photo)

Recommendations:
- Identify and correct moisture source (roof/plumbing above, HVAC duct/boot condensation, high humidity)
- Check with moisture meter/IR; monitor for active dampness
- Remove loose material; dry thoroughly; prime/seal exposed paper; patch/skim, retexture, and repaint
- Replace drywall where softened/swollen or mold-affected
- If home/finish may pre-1980/1978, test texture/paint for asbestos/lead before disturbance
- Improve ventilation/dehumidification; ensure exhaust fans operate properly
