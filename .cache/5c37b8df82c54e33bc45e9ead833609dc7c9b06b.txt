Location:
- Interior wall/ceiling with textured drywall near a vent/register (exact room not specified)

Observations:
- Textured paint/skim coat with heavy blistering and flaking
- Large areas of peeling; drywall paper visible in multiple spots
- Edges curling/lifting; scattered small cracks around failed areas

Potential Issues:
- Substrate exposure (drywall paper)
- Likely past or ongoing water intrusion causing adhesion failure
- Gaps/voids and loose material may fall
- Possible mold/mildew risk if moisture persists
- Cracks at peel boundaries
- Possible lead-based paint if home pre-1978

Recommendations:
- Locate and correct moisture source (roof/plumbing/HVAC/condensation); check with moisture meter
- Dry the area; improve ventilation/dehumidification as needed
- Safely remove all loose/failed coatings; test for lead and follow EPA RRP if positive
- Spot-treat for staining, prime with stain-blocking primer; patch/skim coat damaged drywall, retexture and repaint
- Inspect adjacent/hidden cavities for moisture and microbial growth; monitor for recurrence
