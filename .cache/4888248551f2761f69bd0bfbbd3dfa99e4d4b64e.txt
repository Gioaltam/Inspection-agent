Location:
- Ceiling of laundry/utility room.

Observations:
- Popcorn ceiling with heavy peeling paint; several large patches exposing underlying substrate.
- Central ceiling vent/grille present.
- Adjacent walls/contents (laundry supplies) visible in photo.

Potential Issues:
- Suspected moisture intrusion indicated by widespread peeling; possible hidden mold behind patches.
- Exposed substrate and paint failure may worsen if moisture continues.
- Possible asbestos in older popcorn ceilings; testing advised before disturbance.

Recommendations:
- Inspect for source of moisture (roof/plumbing/vent) and repair as needed; check above ceiling if accessible.
- Contain/remove damaged material and re-surface; treat with mold-resistant primer/paint after drying.
- If home built before 1980 or asbestos is a concern, arrange asbestos testing prior to any removal; use licensed abatement if detected.
- Improve ventilation and consider dehumidification to reduce future moisture.
