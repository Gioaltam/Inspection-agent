- Ceiling vent opening: metal vent cover with louvers; mounted in textured plaster/drywall ceiling.
- Surface conditions: dust/dirt on blades; dark staining around the vent frame suggesting moisture or soot progress.
- Finish issue: peeling/cracking paint around the vent area; minor ceiling edge cracking.
- Structural/fit: cover appears securely fastened; no sagging observed.
- Recommendations: clean vent and louvers; inspect for moisture intrusion (roof/plumbing) if staining recurs; consider repainting after moisture resolved.
