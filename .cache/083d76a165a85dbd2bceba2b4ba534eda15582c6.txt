Location:
- Kitchen cabinet under sink; garbage disposal unit installed with dishwasher drain hose and supply lines present.

Observations:
- Black garbage disposal unit; gray corrugated dishwasher drain hose attached.
- Brown staining/soil buildup on the cabinet floor beneath the disposal.
- No active water pooling visible in photo; no clear entry of standing water.
- Hose routing appears to loop near the disposal but unclear if a proper high loop/air gap is present.

Potential Issues:
- Past or present moisture intrusion evidenced by cabinet floor staining.
- Possible improper dishwasher drain hose routing (risk of backflow if no proper high loop or air gap).
- Possible corrosion or residue around the disposal area indicated by staining (could progress if leaks continue).

Recommendations:
- Inspect disposal connections and trap for leaks; reseal or replace gaskets as needed.
- Re-route dishwasher drain hose to a proper high loop or install an air-gap device.
- Clean and dry the cabinet area; monitor for new staining or moisture ingress; address any wood/particleboard damage.
- If staining recurs or mold/mildew appears, treat and remediate; if corrosion or leaking persists, consider component replacement.
