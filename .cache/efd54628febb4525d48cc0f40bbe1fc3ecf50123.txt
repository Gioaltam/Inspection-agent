Location: Frosted window (lower sash)

What I See:
- Spiderâ€‘web cracking radiating from an impact point.
- Cracks span most of the pane.

Issues to Address:
- Broken/cracked glass pane posing a safety hazard and compromised weather/insulation seal.

Recommended Action:
- Do not operate the window; tape both sides of the pane to stabilize and prevent loose shards.
- Hire a glazier to replace the damaged pane (or sash) as soon as practical; specify tempered/safety glass per current code for privacy/wet areas.
- Inspect/caulk around the glazing during replacement to ensure a proper seal.
