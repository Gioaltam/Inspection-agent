Location: Frosted window (interior)

What I See:
- Lower sash glass has spiderâ€‘web cracking from an impact point.
- Window frame appears intact.

Issues to Address:
- Broken/cracked glass pane (safety hazard).

Recommended Action:
- Avoid operating the window; tape both sides of the pane as a temporary safety measure.
- Hire a glazing contractor to replace the damaged pane (match the frosted/obscure glass). If this is in a bathroom or other hazardous location, use tempered safety glass.
- Verify smooth operation and weather seal after replacement.
