Location:
- Exterior front porch wall with two windows under vinyl soffit

Observations:
- Vinyl perforated soffit; light-blue siding and trim; dark aluminum-framed windows
- Right window has insect screen; screen appears aged/tattered
- Perimeter caulk around window frames looks aged and sporadically cracked
- Exterior cable/wire routed along fascia/soffit
- Concrete porch with two chairs; loose mirror leaning against wall
- Windows/frames and siding visibly dirty/weathered

Potential Issues:
- Torn/damaged insect screen at right lower window — pest entry point
- Failed/missing sealant/caulk at window perimeters; small gaps at trim/frame joints — potential water/air intrusion
- Algae/mildew-like staining on siding/soffit and frames
- Loose/sagging exterior cable along soffit — subject to mechanical damage
- Trip/fall and breakage hazard from mirror leaning on porch

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair torn window screen; verify screen frame secure
- Clean windows, frames, and siding; treat mildew/algae; monitor for recurrence
- Remove or securely mount mirror; keep walkway clear
- Re-caulk/seal around window perimeters; repair any gaps/voids; repaint trim as needed
- Properly secure/route exterior cable with approved fasteners/protection; have qualified technician evaluate if utility/electrical requirements are unclear
- Check window operation and weatherstripping; repair/upgrade as needed
