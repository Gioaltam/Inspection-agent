Location:
- Front porch exterior wall; two adjacent windows beneath vinyl soffit

Observations:
- Light-blue lap siding with trim; black metal-framed double-hung windows
- Right lower sash has torn/degraded screen or plastic film; left appears intact
- Perimeter caulk around window frames appears aged/patchy; small gaps visible at joints
- Vinyl soffit present; loose low-voltage/cable wire routed along soffit/trim
- Dirt/grime on glass and siding; organic staining under soffit
- Mirror and patio chairs placed in front of windows

Potential Issues:
- Torn/deteriorated screen/film at right window—pest entry point
- Gaps/failed caulk at window perimeters—potential water intrusion
- Unsecured cable along soffit—susceptible to damage; possible code/safety concern
- Organic staining/mildew on siding/soffit—indicative of moisture and deferred maintenance
- Trip/fall hazard from mirror leaning on wall and items obstructing walkway

Recommendations:
- Replace/repair damaged window screen or remove/replace deteriorated film; verify glass is sound
- Clean and re-seal window perimeters with exterior-grade sealant; seal any gaps at trim/joints
- Properly secure or reroute cable with approved fasteners/conduit; seal wall penetrations
- Clean siding/soffit; treat mildew and monitor for recurring moisture
- Remove or secure mirror and maintain clear egress on porch
