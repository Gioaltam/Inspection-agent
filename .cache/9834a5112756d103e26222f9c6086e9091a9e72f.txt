Location:
- Small walk-in storage closet with two wooden shelves; white walls; tiled floor. Items: paper towel roll, rolled material, lumber scraps, vacuum.

Observations:
- Shelves appear rough-cut pine, minimally bracket-supported; no center support visible.
- Contents crowded: vacuum leaning on left wall; cords/hose dangling; rolled paper and scraps on shelves.
- Lower shelf shows stained/darker plywood; miscellaneous scrap wood on it.
- No obvious water stains, mold, or wiring concerns visible.

Potential Issues:
- Shelves may not be securely fastened; risk of sag or detachment under load.
- Lower shelf with stain/dark areas; potential moisture/chemical exposure or warping.
- Narrow aisle with loose vacuum/cords; trip/fall hazard.
- Flammable can/chemical items stored on floor near wood scraps (improper storage).

Recommendations:
- Secure shelves to wall studs and add a center support or extra brackets to prevent failure.
- Inspect lower shelf; replace/repair any warped or stained boards; seal wood to resist moisture.
- Reorganize: store vacuum with cords neatly; consider wall-mounted hanger or bin to free floor space.
- Move any flammable/chemical items to proper storage (closed cabinet or away from heat), and keep a tidy, dust-free environment.
