Location:
- Main exterior entry door (interior view), adjacent to storm door

Observations:
- Painted six‑panel entry door with brass knob and deadbolt; peephole present
- Heavy surface wear; paint heavily worn/peeling
- Torn/delaminated door skin around latch/lock area
- Chipped/damaged bottom edge of door
- Visible rust/discoloration near knob/deadbolt
- Aluminum storm door frame visible; tile threshold

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/tears and substrate exposure at latch area and bottom edge
- Peeling/failed paint and missing protective coating
- Corrosion/rust at lock area; possible metal skin deterioration
- Gaps/voids from missing material around hardware; potential water/pest entry
- Security concern: damaged door skin may not hold lockset securely
- Possible moisture intrusion leading to further decay at lower door

Recommendations:
- Replace severely damaged door slab; ensure new unit is properly sized and weather‑sealed
- Replace/secure lockset and reinforce strike; verify deadbolt operation
- Install new weatherstripping and door sweep; adjust threshold for tight seal
- Prime (rust‑inhibiting) and paint/seal all faces and edges of replacement door
- Inspect and seal/caulk exterior door frame and threshold; repair any related damage
