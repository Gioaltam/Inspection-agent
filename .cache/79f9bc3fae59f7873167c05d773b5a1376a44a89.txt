Location:
- Main entry door (interior view) with storm door/metal threshold

Observations:
- Painted raisedâ€‘panel exterior door; brass knob + deadbolt; peephole
- Heavy wear/soil; paint peeling/flaking on multiple panels
- Chipped/deteriorated material at latch edge and lower panels; bottom edge nicked
- Area around knob/deadbolt visibly damaged; substrate exposed
- Tarnished/corroded door hardware
- Aluminum storm door frame and threshold present

Potential Issues:
- Cracks/peeling/failed finish with substrate exposure
- Voids/gaps and delamination at latch area and bottom edge
- Deteriorated material around lockset may compromise security
- Corrosion on hardware
- Water intrusion risk due to unsealed, exposed substrate
- Potential pest entry via damaged edges/voids
- Minor cut/snag hazard from splintered edges

Recommendations:
- Replace door slab for durability and security; alternatively, rebuild damaged areas with exterior epoxy filler, then sand, prime, and repaint all sides/edges
- Replace corroded lockset/deadbolt; secure strike plate with long screws into framing
- Install/replace weatherstripping and door sweep; adjust hinges/strike for proper fit
- Clean and reseal/caulk joints at jamb and threshold; repaint as needed
- If house built before 1978, test for lead-based paint before disturbing finishes
