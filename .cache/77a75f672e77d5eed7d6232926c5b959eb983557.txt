Location:
- Under kitchen sink cabinet.

Observations:
- White PVC sink drain with P-trap entering wall through a short elbow and wall plate.
- Two angle-stop supply valves with flexible/metal conduit connections present.
- Back wall panel shows brown staining and dust; bottom edge/trim shows wear.
- Electrical conduits/wiring located close to plumbing; no obvious GFCI visible.
- Patch or plate around drain connection suggests a past repair.

Potential Issues:
- Past moisture stain on back panel suggests prior leak or ongoing moisture risk.
- Possible drip/leak at drain/ slip-joint connection; tighten or reseal as needed.
- Corrosion/oxidation on metal fittings (angle stops) may indicate wear or impending leak.
- Electrical wiring in proximity to plumbing without clear protection or separation; potential code/safety concern.
- Substrate exposure/wood behind panel showing wear; potential for rot if moisture persists.
- Gaps at cabinet base could allow pest entry or moisture intrusion.

Recommendations:
- Have a plumber inspect drain connections; reseal/slip-joints as needed and verify proper venting.
- Inspect and possibly replace corroded supply valves; consider upgrading to braided stainless lines.
- Address moisture: dry area, treat any mold, and repair back panel/cabinet if rot is present.
- Reorganize/protect wiring from moisture; ensure GFCI protection where required and secure conduits away from water.
- Seal penetrations and finish the cabinet backing to prevent future moisture intrusion.
