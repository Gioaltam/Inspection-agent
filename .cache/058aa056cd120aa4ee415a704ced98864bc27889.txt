Location: Roof eave/edge by side wall

What I See:
- Multiple shingles are torn/missing with underlayment and a gap at the roof edge exposed.
- Fascia/edge board and metal drip edge/flashing appear deteriorated and displaced; debris trapped in the opening.

Issues to Address:
- Openings in roofing allow water intrusion.
- Rotted/damaged fascia/edge board and likely compromised roof sheathing.
- Loose/bent drip edge/flashing.

Recommended Action:
- Urgent: Cover area with a tarp or temporary patch to prevent leaks.
- Hire a roofing contractor to remove damaged materials, replace any rotted sheathing and fascia, install new drip edge/flashing and underlayment, then re-shingle the section.
- Verify and repair sidewall/step flashing adjacent to the repair area.
- Inspect interior/attic below for moisture damage after repairs.
