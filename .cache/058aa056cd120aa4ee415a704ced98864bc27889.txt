Location: Roof edge/valley at eave next to exterior wall

What I See:
- Shingles are torn/missing, leaving an open gap along the valley/eave.
- Fascia/edge wood is split and deteriorated; debris present in the opening.

Issues to Address:
- Exposed underlayment/decking from missing shinglesâ€”high risk of active leaks.
- Deteriorated/split fascia and possible rotten roof decking at the edge.
- Improvised tape patch is not weatherproof; debris obstructing drainage.

Recommended Action:
- Urgently install a temporary waterproof cover (tarp or peel-and-stick) before the next rain.
- Hire a licensed roofer to remove damaged materials, replace any rotten decking and fascia, install proper valley flashing/drip edge and ice/water shield, then re-shingle the area.
- Clean out debris and trim vegetation back from the roof.
- Check adjacent attic/soffit and interior wall for moisture damage and repair as needed.
