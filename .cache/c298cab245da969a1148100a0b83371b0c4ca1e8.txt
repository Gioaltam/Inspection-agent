Location: Entry door – bottom corner at threshold

What I See:
- Vertical split/crack at the door’s lower edge near the jamb
- Paint chipped with exposed wood/substrate

Issues to Address:
- Cracked/splitting door corner with exposed material

Recommended Action:
- Stabilize and repair: dry the area, inject wood glue or use exterior wood epoxy, clamp if possible, then sand, prime, and repaint.
- If the door feels soft/warped or the crack extends, replace the door slab.
- Check door sweep/weatherstrip and caulk at the threshold to prevent future moisture intrusion.
