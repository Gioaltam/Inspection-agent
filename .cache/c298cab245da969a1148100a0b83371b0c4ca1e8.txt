Location: Entry door â€“ bottom corner/threshold

What I See:
- Vertical split/delamination at the lower corner of the door slab with paint flaking and exposed substrate.
- Dirt/wear at the threshold area.

Issues to Address:
- Door slab is damaged at the lower corner (likely moisture-related delamination/incipient rot).

Recommended Action:
- Probe the area for softness. If damage is minor/localized: remove loose material, treat with wood hardener, rebuild with exterior epoxy filler, sand, prime, and repaint.
- If the soft/crumbled area extends more than about an inch or two, plan to replace the door slab.
- Address moisture entry: inspect and replace door sweep/weatherstripping as needed, and re-caulk the threshold-to-jamb seams to keep water out.
